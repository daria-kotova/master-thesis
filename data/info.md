"strive" in Swedish

Initial release: 2009, San Francisco, California.

Strava is an American internet service for tracking physical exercise which incorporates social network features.

Strava records data for a user's activities, which can then be shared with the user's followers or shared publicly (route summary, elevation, speed, timing, power and heart rate). Activities can be recorded using the mobile app or from devices manufactured by third parties like _Garmin_, Google Fit, Suunto, and Wahoo. Activities can also be entered manually via the Strava website.

Strava Art is made using your GPS computer to create a picture while exercising. It can be cycling, running, swimming, walking, hiking, skiing. Your activity is then synced with Strava.com to reveal your artwork.

Over 3,000 pieces of art (Gary Cordery, graphic designer, typographical print maker and cyclist on Strava.)
