# Dasha (translated by me from Russian)

Started running a year ago. Ran one 5k race. Beginner. GPS-drawing - a bird, 2k.

_On planning process_

Tha hardest thing was to come up with the idea of what to run. I am not a very creative person and do not have much imagination. It was hard. I first opened Strava from my ccomputer, looked at what other people run, got shocked. Then I tried to draw using the website you had sent me. But it drew something weird, I tried a star and it gave me some scribbles. So, I decided just to look at the map. At first I had ideas, but I couldn't find anything from them in the map and so I just studied the map.

_On the run itself_

I started running and then I realised that I had already missed the turn I was supposed to take, because it appeared too quickly. When I was running I checked the map on the phoone, but not all the time. This is why I missed it and decided to come back later. When you walk you have time to look around, but not when you run. Besides, I was running without an app, just with the map on my phone and it didn't let me know when I need to turn like a GPS-navigator would do. This is why you can miss a turn. It would be cool if the application let you know in advance when you needed to turn.

_On experiencce and motivation_

It was cool. There's motivation to run till the end when there's a drawing. It really works. But I faced with this difficulty. The fact that I had to come up with my own idea of what to draw. It would be cool if you could open the map and the AI proposed to you predefined drawings. It would be more interesting and you wouldn't have to lose time. Also, another thing. Usually, when I go on a run I start straight away from my house. And here you need to get to a certain point and start from there, finish your run and then go back.

_On continuing_

Well, I tried it and thought to myself: wow, that's cool. But it's getting colder now, so I don't think I would run. But if it had been at the beginning of the summer, I would have continued.
