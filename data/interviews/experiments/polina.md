_On how she planned_

I was thinking on making either a rose or a fish. The rose didn't work out. The fish.. I think it turned out well, it's more a whale, but I think it's somewhat successful. Not an exceptional beauty, but it least you can recognise it.

_On how it felt_

It was fun, distracted me a bit from constantly looking at my watch. And there's this thing: well you'll finish for sure, there's a goal, you have to. It was easier.

_On motivation_

I would try it again if someone drew the route for me. I prefer my usual route. I think these drawings are good on difficult days when you're like: uuuugh, I have to go. When you run them you run in the streets that are new for you, it won't be 100% the route you normally run. So it makes it fun, it brings some novelty. And in this way it's easier for you to run, because it's more interesting for your brain when there's something new around.

I think everyone can find something in this. A beginner to start running and it's interesting. And an amateur to change a bit his routine, because it's fun, everyone's posting on Strava now.
