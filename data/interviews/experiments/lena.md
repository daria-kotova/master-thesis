_On her GPS-drawing experience_

When I was planning on my own, I was looking at the map and I couldn't see anything at all. When I ran the first time I didn't try to see something in the map, like the second time with your help. As experience showed, it's much easier not to come up with something in your head of what you want, but instead look and see something in the map and draw it. Like with crossroads. When you plan in advance, it's easier.

I was running with my phone and various applications. I was looking at the photo that you had sent to me, I had my tracker open on the phone, and I also had the normal map open so that I could understand where the different paths were. While running, I wasn't relaxed as usual, when I just run, turn on my music, even though the music was playing this time. I always run with music. I was more focused on the details and I was thinking on where I had to turn, what path I had to take. So I was more overwhelmed with this information.

_On relation with motivation_

I found it interesting to make a drawing, because I hadn't tried it before. And I wanted to participate in it to cross it out from the list. I had a goal to help you. It's not llike it was a burden for me, in the moment it was interesting and you want to finish the drawing, you aren't going to stop.

But for me it works differently. I need to run 5k for example, minimum 5, and I can't let myself stop, because you can't run less than 5, because my coach once told me that 5k is ok, but les - not really. But of course it's different for everyone. I usually run the same route that I like, that I'm used to it. And I run with music and enjoy this process.
