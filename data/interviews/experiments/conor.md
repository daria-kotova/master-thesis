Do you mind, before we start to do the GPS art, do you mind telling me a bit about your running experience, when and why you started?

Sure, um... Wait, I'm sorry.

Hehe.

I've been running about five years, and I'd say the past three years I've been running more than I did the first two. And I mainly have been doing it as a form of exercise. So I was...

Did you start it? You started it before college, right?

I started before COVID. I started basically when I arrived in Geneva. That's when I started running. I had tried before and would run once or twice and give up. I did that many times and then once I moved to Geneva, I started to do it more consistently.

Okay, so now you run how many times per...

Usually five or six times a week.

nearly every day okay and you participate in races right

Yes, a little bit, but not too seriously.

So, um, like, marathon?

The longest I've done is a half marathon. I've done a couple. I did the Geneva half twice

Yeah, yeah

And then I did, there's one called the Three Country Marathon in Basel, that goes, yeah, Switzerland, Germany, and France.

Are you going to do one in your son? No.

I don't really enjoy it.

Like, you can still register, you don't like, um... I... I...

I like the Escalade wrist. Have you done that one?

I wanted to, but it's like it was in December, right? And I wasn't ready. It will be very cold, slippery, and so I didn't.

Oh, it is cold and slippery, but it's fun. But it's also huge, right? Yeah.

I don't like heels.

It's really, really fun. So that's the only race I always do. And then the other ones I just sometimes do by accident.

How did you learn about GPS art? How did I learn about GPS art?

TPS art, you know from you pretty much

You haven't seen any examples before?

Not too much, although I think I had a friend who wrote a message through Strava, because I think it got picked up in a magazine in the United States. She was bragging about it, and now that I think about it, it's kind of like art.

Do you have Instagram? Have you never seen like because it's a good time? Well at least now I see tons of them all the time.

No, I don't, and I'm on Strava, but I don't really see it.

Tell me about the planning process.

That was hard. It was hard to think of a design and then it was very hard to figure out where in the city I could make the design and then I had to change the design to fit the city and then had to change the location because I found problems with the one I had chosen.

But you stick to your original idea, right? I think I...

Yeah, I think I stuck pretty much to my original idea, but I changed the location at the last minute.

How much time did you spend on plattings?

Total maybe 45 minutes. Wow. I'm sorry.

No, it's okay. No, it's fine. Did you do the Instagram or Google Maps?

I tried the website, so Strava, I'm not a paid subscriber, so I couldn't use their tool. And then that other website you gave me would have been good, but I couldn't figure out how to use it. So then I just used Google Maps and my eyeball, which wasn't great.

So you kind of like save the Google Maps image and then you run with it. No, I just

I mean basically I looked for a part of the city that Plan Palais is pretty open, and it was more or less in the design I wanted to do. So I just knew from the Google Map where I needed to...

as you memorize your roots.

Yeah, should I tell you what I was doing? You're gonna show me. Okay. Okay, let's have a look. Well, I don't have to show you, but basically, okay, there's a band I like called Fishbone, and they have a logo of a fish, a dead fish, with the bones.

So, Plant Palais kind of looks like the fish shape, so I could look at the map and know kind of where.

Wait, did you tell me about this before? Yeah, okay. I remember that this summer.

So I'll show you the logo, this is what I was going for, something like that. And now that I, I know I made a mistake but

But you really didn't even follow any math, it has memorized the root.

Yeah, pretty

much but it's easy for Plum Pellet because you'll see this doesn't work for your audio recorder but see Plum Pellet kind of looks like a fish standing up so I only had to look at this map and I would know okay this is the head this is the tail and from this I could figure out

what to do. Okay. Are you still kind of ran blindly? Yes, I ran very blindly. Well, that's it. No pressure. I'm excited.

Thank you very much.

Oh, it's okay.

that's not

Great.

There is the tail though.

It looks kind of vulgar. That's supposed to be the tail. This was supposed to be the head. The problem, which I realized, is I shouldn't have done the outline of the fish.

You shouldn't?

See how the

Ah, yeah. Yes, yeah.

It looks like a brazil, like a meat that you wrap up in.

Yeah.

Okay, that wasn't good.

That was still an experiment. Can you send me a screenshot of this?

I also ran into a problem. I didn't realize this area is a skate park that's closed And I actually popped the fence to try to know but then it was like Too difficult and it was raining so I had to go around it and that contributed to the problem.

brother in the rain.

No, but it was just their puddles, it was a first case.

Wow, that wasn't what I thought.

Well, maybe you should have followed some map.

I think even if I followed them out, well you're right, if I had drawn it I would have known that it wouldn't look good. It's interesting though because the...

Thanks for watching!

The things that I thought would be bad when I ran the race or when I ran this thing were not the same things that were bad now that I looked at like

Like what, for example?

My straight lines would be really off, but they came out okay.

I think if you zoom in, they're probably, yeah, they're not like, you see, they're not super perfect, but then if you zoom out, it's okay.

but I thought they would be worse.

Mmm, and how long is it?

and I'll see you next week.

23 minutes, 44 seconds, 2 and a half miles.

Five? Yeah.

Thank you very much.

Yeah.

Do you know that you can see how you ran like this? Really? Ah, no. I can't. I can't.

Can you see how I ran?

Oh, actually...

I would say I'm not a good artist to begin with, so I'm not surprised by Strava art. It came out so fast, but when I ran it I thought it would look better than what it actually looks like.

I think it's really the thing that you didn't use a map and you know, it's just nice. Because I tried, well, it's a bit different because it's still like, you know Plant Palais, you know, but I tried doing this experiment with my friend where like we went to Park La Croche.

Yeah. And we were giving each other tasks of running, but like without maps, so you're like, really you just had to orientate like by imagining where you are. And it's like, it was very difficult, like this is a cloud.

But I mean, it kind of resembles, but like...

This was my

My friend, you kind of did better. Yeah, that's pretty good. But yeah, it's like when you have a map that shows you where exactly you're running, it's much easier.

Yeah.

How did I watch out? How did it feel?

It was fun in a lot of ways because It gave me something else to think about like I forgot about The running and I was more interested in trying to get the good good lines It was kind of funny too because there were so many people around and I was sometimes like doing these weird little Straight back straight back.

Yeah, people thought I was crazy or something where I had some strange like workout plan

And that was kind of-

Greens, okay? Yeah!

And it was difficult too because there were many more obstacles in reality than there were on the map. So I didn't plan for people walking babies or a van to be in my way.

or like them pass with the skateboard Exactly

So there were some challenges during it so it was like

Yeah, it was pretty interesting, it was pretty fun.

Bye!

Can I ask you, what is your profession?

Yeah, I'm a diplomat.

Okay, so you talk to people yeah, because yeah, you said that you're very creative

yeah I'm not artistic at all like I just I think

I actually think I can't imagine anything. I think I have a...

you cannot. No. I mean it's a matter of practice. No I don't think I have. No it is a matter of practice. What? Like creativity is a skill that you can develop.

I don't think I would be able to.

I read some of this. I read some of this.

something that said there are some people who can't okay I have a friend who is a writer she writes great novels and great short stories and poems and she told me like if I say orange she imagines the fruit in front of her like she can picture it like I can't

What do you imagine? Nothing. If I say elephant...

I know the concept of elephant, but I'm not seeing an elephant in my mind.

Cheers!

If I say lampelé, what do you imagine?

Well now I'm imagining a map.

So, it kind of works with some things. If I say... Le Tour de Fèil. What? Eiffel Tower. Oh.

I can see a knife at home, yeah. But it doesn't work with elephants. But I don't know, for her it was very vivid.

I also imagine an orange and elephants and all this stuff.

It's almost like there's a concept of an elephant or an Eiffel Tower, but it's not vivid for me.

I don't know

So I think I have an artistic disability.

No, I think there are like two halves of the brain, one is for artistic stuff, for creativity, and then there's another one. And I guess yours is more the other one that is more developed. But I'm sure when you were a kid, you would draw in some sense.

Yeah, but it was never good.

Wow, kids don't draw good stuff. Yes, they do. My nieces are great artists.

how old is she like eight and six both of them are great

I love you.

I definitely wasn't doing that when I was very young.

So, would you say that this thing at TPSR is something that can help with motivation?

um in general

Or for me? For me?

No. Because...

It was fun to try once, but I don't think I, one, have the ability to make something look cool, and two, it's not my priority for running. Like, I'm more interested in running for...

We'll catch those.

Athletic reasons. Athletic reasons.

and then days, time, distance and so forth. But, for example, if there was time on example noon, and I would prepare a route for you with the drawing for the distance that you want.

I mean, I would do it, yeah, I would do it, but I guess I would do it just to help you out if you needed someone to do it. Okay, so it's not like something for yourself? It's not for me, no.

Okay, and if we talk about like in general, like people who are struggling with motivation, what do you think? I think it could help.

I think I could help some people, um, I'm trying to think like

Thanks for watching!

If there's a way to I almost think like if there was a way to turn it into a game because The benefit of this For me, I think is it gets your mind off of the running? Yeah, and so you forget a lot of the negative things about running So if you could turn it into a game somehow and I don't know how but then I think people who are not runners if they want to like Get moving it could help them move,

but I don't know how you do that

Like when you say, when you mention game, like what aspects of the game do you like? Like getting rewards, different levels, what is it?

good question yeah I don't know I mean maybe I'm talking about something different from Strava art because I think

Okay.

I know I'm trying to think of how best to express it so there's a guy that you interviewed today who this is his thing

Thanks for watching!

I'm I'm trying to think people who aren't runners What do you get out of

Thank you very much.

You can't make something out of Strava art as good as you can with your hands, so I don't quite understand the appeal.

I mean, it's so good.

I'm sorry, maybe...

I don't know, it just destroyed my whole project, no, well it's a form of art, just like, I don't know, there is like water art where when people draw with ink on the water and then leave some traces and then it like kind of smudges, so I don't know, but, wait.

I'm kind of losing my trail of thought. So I was talking to this guy and the reason he started doing it was because he found it really fun. He was like doing some drawings as a joke, like playing with many new words and stuff like that and then he started creating competitions, they were kind of like motivating different people to participate.

And then he started doing it for a cause, like as a fundraising, so like running and I, yeah, running for something. I'm so sorry, what was it?

the people who enjoy Strava are who are they that's i think what you're saying because it doesn't i'm not understanding the appeal okay because uh

You are not the only person who has to do that and write like some people who do not run as much as you do. When they do it, they say exactly the same thing as you did, that it helps to kind of shift your focus from looking at the watch, checking the numbers, thinking about the distance you have to do.

It shifts to thinking about the next turn and focusing on the final goal. And I found myself that it has motivation, because on the days when it's raining like it was two days ago, or you do not feel well, or you're just lazy, you don't have much motivation to go out running.

Once you start with GPSR, well, you kind of have to finish it because otherwise you have this unfinished piece of roots and what are you going to do with that? So I really think that it's something that may help with motivation.

I feel it myself and some of the people that I talk to have confirmed it. So I was just curious about what you think of it. Well, I guess you don't think it can be useful. I mean, not for you. Just for me, yeah.

But I think it has something to do with my lack of artistic ability.

more than anything I just so I think like if there were

for

I imagine you are preparing for something like a marathon or whatever, and obviously you have those long runs.

and

If you had a choice of doing a long run, which I don't know how long it should be, like 25k say, you can do it like the usual way.

Thanks for watching!

Or you can do it in a fun way, as in like, I prefer a root for you. And maybe you don't even know what the root is. As in, you don't know what the final image is. And you can run it, but you know for sure that there will be some surprise at the end.

And you will see what the image is.

Oh, very cool.

So which one of two would you choose?

the second one.

And what if you knew what the image was?

you

But still, it's like you're boring routes in the park or like you run an image.

I love you.

I would probably do the one in the park I mean especially if I'm preparing for a race

long run, because long runs are not about speed, they are really about the distance. Or like at your level, it's also about the speed.

But it's like

Part of me would be

Okay, maybe there's a way around this, but one annoying thing I find, because most of my runs I do straight and back.

Okay.

because i don't want to get lost and i don't want to and also like another

Thanks for watching!

Another thing is like you know how Strava can sometimes you go to a new town. It'll give you ideas for runs and I think some of those are great, but I find it hard to I Hate checking my watch and then checking my phone and say I have to take a right here.

So That's my least favorite part of the run. So if I had to keep doing that especially for a long run I would go crazy

really if you had a phone in your hands it would annoy you because this is how I run now like with a phone that shows me where exactly I am where I need to turn really

All right.

Well, I have to do my drawing something right

Annoying

No, actually, because when I started running, I was like, I don't want to take my phone with me, it's going to distract me because I have something in my hand. But now, I mean, it's fine, but at the same time I didn't have a goal of running at a certain speed, I just want to finish.

So for me, it doesn't really bother.

So your goal is usually the distance?

Right now, yes, because before I was training, when I was training for my first 10k, I wanted to run until an hour, so then of course it was more about time and pace and all, but now it's just like finished, it's good.

is running your primary sport.

Well, in the winter I do snowboarding, in the summer I did wakesurf, so running is in between to stay fit. Interesting.

No, I just... For me, it's just not a piece of paper.

Did you do other sports?

Yeah, I ski in the winter, I cycle a bit, and I'm boxing a little bit, but for me running is just a consistent one, because I can do it so easily, you just put on, you know, sneakers and you go, so it's taken over the other sports a lot, but I do, there's something for me about it being mindless, and being able, like once I have a route, I tend to do it all the time, and then maybe I find another route,

and then I do that, like I rarely change.

Do I understand correctly? Is it because, like I said, mindful, so once you have a roof and you know it, you do not have to think about it. So you just run your distance and your pace and direction is really not your concern.

And this is why probably Strava is like, because it requires a lot of attention and focus. Okay, so this is why it's not something that it appears to you? Yeah, I think it.

Find it out.

Okay, I see. Oh, it's fair.

on the side.

it's okay but like if you once again going back to the question like if you try to imagine someone okay who's not a beginner but who is like not like Yola and they're struggling with motivation

Yes, I have no idea.

I do think there's a way to harness. I think you're right, there's a way to harness this for motivation, for beginners, and for other types of runners. Okay, this is maybe different.

See you next time.

you see there's a website that came out like three or four months ago and all it is is like there are like 10 ,000

Tiles.

that are white or black and if you click it, it turns from white to black and they're in a square.

What is it called?

Let me see if I can find it. See ya.

Thanks for watching!

And you thought I was completely off topic. No, what I was saying was, I don't know what it's called, but there's a website this guy created with these tiles. And it's a community website, so anyone who clicks one of the tiles turns it over.

And some people were making designs in it, some people were trying to turn them all white, some people were trying to turn them all black. If there was a way to combine the running with some kind of a community,

I have already this, like the guy with who I talked forever today, he talked to me about this runs that he did, well he prepared them, he prepared the routes, but then they were like relays, so I guess some people were running like a part of it and then passing the next part to the next person and then all together and made some point.

But like the problem with your website is that there is no coordination. I know. So you cannot really create something because someone will be like making a house and another person will be making a cloud and they will be like just a mess in the end.

I know, I'm trying to think.

I don't know how to do it, but I'm just saying that kind of a competition, turning it into a game. Even like, for me, one thing that would motivate me would be if I had a, if Strava could tell me, like if I wanted to run through every street of Geneva, and then each time I ran through one it would mark it off, and then I would see a map of the city and every single city.

It's like a completion.

but it would just be like exploration of...

There is actually a type of GPS art. I don't remember the name, but it starts with beef. Where basically people, they try to run all the streets within a certain area. This is also called art, which is, well, it's not really art though.

Yeah, but that one...

That would motivate me more.

Yeah, what about writing for a coach? But like, doing to get started is something. Sure.

Okay, what about running for a close?

Just running or running for a course doing the GPS art that someone else made for you.

Equally

Okay, I got it. No, it's fine.

I'm being honest.

No, it's useful. It's normal that not everyone is into it. Well, I think I can see.
