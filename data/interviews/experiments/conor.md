_On how he learnt about GPS-drawings_

You know, from you pretty much. I had a friend who wrote a message through Strava, because I think it got picked up in a magazine in the United States. She was bragging about it, and now that I think about it, it's kind of like art.

_On planning_

That was hard. It was hard to think of a design. And then it was very hard to figure out where in the city I could make the design. And then I had to change the design to fit the city and then had to change the location, because I found problems with the one I had chosen. I think I stuck pretty much to my original idea, but I changed the location at the last minute.

_On his impression_

How did I watch out? How did it feel?

It was fun in a lot of ways, because it gave me something else to think about. Like I forgot about the running and I was more interested in trying to get the good lines. It was kind of funny too, because there were so many people around and I was sometimes like doing these weird little Straight back straight back. And it was difficult too, because there were many more obstacles in reality than there were on the map. So I didn't plan for people walking babies or a van to be in my way.So there were some challenges during it.

_On motivation_

It was fun to try once, but I don't think I, one, have the ability to make something look cool, and two, it's not my priority for running. Like, I'm more interested in running for athletic reasons.

If there's a way to turn it into a game, because the benefit of this for me is it gets your mind off of the running. And so you forget a lot of the negative things about running. So if you could turn it into a game somehow, then I think people who are not runners if they want to get moving.

_On his doubts_

I'm trying to think, people who aren't runners.. What do you get out of it? You can't make something out of Strava art as good as you can with your hands, so I don't quite understand the appeal.

Another thing is, sometimes you go to a new town. It'll give you ideas for runs and I think some of those are great, but I find it hard. I hate checking my watch and then checking my phone and say I have to take a right here. So that's my least favorite part of the run. So if I had to keep doing that especially for a long run I would go crazy
