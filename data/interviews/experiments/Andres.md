Before we talk about this, could you please tell a bit about your running experience, when you started, why?

I think I started running when I was like 15 and it was a way for me to just, let's say, release all of the tension with myself and stuff like that. When I moved to Germany, I think I started doing it way more, because the winter was super harsh. So that was another way of having a strong mind.

So sometimes I didn't want to do anything and just stay home, but I kind of pushed myself to do it and go outside. And despite the weather conditions, I would do it just as a way, as a coping mechanism.

Have you ever done it in the rain?

Yeah. I've done it in all conditions, but, yeah, I guess it's been a way to just release the energy and just not find excuses not to do it.

But you still do it?

But no, actually, when I did my internship, I kind of stopped doing it, because it was a new routine for me and everything. I didn't actually do it as much, especially because I was super tired after this new routine and everything. So yeah, I would say it's been more than a year that I don't run as frequently. But in summer, I did run like four times, and it was also 7-8k. And now that I was running, I was also thinking about running in the weather conditions. I think it's different when you see the sun and you're enjoying your time.

I mean it was like 35 in Spain?

In Majorca it was like 30. Yeah, because then I can go home and then just swim in the ocean afterwards. So it's kind of a reward after, like swimming and stuff after running. But yeah, I guess in harsher weather conditions you just need to push yourself to do it or just have certain goals, so that you train for that goal. And then you kind of have your own running routine. But I guess from person to person it's different.

By goals you mean like training for a race?

For a race or even like tracking your own statistics or stuff like that. But yeah I guess from person to person it's different.

Have you ever done a race?

I have actually, it was like 10k. But it was a really long time ago, I was like 16 or something like this.

So would you say that you're a beginner or a medium?

Yeah, really like a beginner. I guess I'm, let's say, intermediate because I think I can push myself a bit more.

How did you first learn about Strava art or GPS art or this stuff?

GPS art? Actually it's the first time. I mean, I knew that people drew with Strava. I knew that was a thing. You know, during Covid I think. But actually I had no clue that a lot of people were doing it. I thought it was just a viral challenge or something on the internet. Not like people doing it really just because.

Okay. So tell me how our running experience felt.

I felt many things. I guess first of all I was trying to guess what I was doing. Like okay, where is this going to, what am I doing. Trying to connect the dots and understand the patterns of what we're doing. So that was the first thing I felt, you know, trying to understand what I was doing. Then I felt really disoriented. I was like: okay I think I'm doing something, and then I'm doing the opposite thing. In my mind was like: okay, this is odd. I was like; okay this makes no sense and I feel dizzy, like I was not expecting it somehow. I don't know. My mind was like: okay, you're running towards one direction. Nope, we're doing something different you know.

So you didn't like this part?

No, it was just interesting, it was like something new. Then at one point I felt a bit unsafe, because we were going through some paths that were closer to the road, for example, in a bus sort of lane. I was like: I don't know if this is the best thing to do.

I know, I just wanted to continue the line and there was just a little bit left. I know that running on the bus is not the best, but I checked that there were no buses.

No, you know, I was just thinking if an algorithm draws a path then it has to be accurate or safe. But obviously since we were doing it the two of us, we would have each other to check if there was something going on and stuff. But yeah, then after that, how did I feel? At what point I was like: okay, is it over? Because sometimes you were slowing down and then changing a bit the pace. But also I found it really nice that you were also taken into consideration, let's say, more residential areas, because we wanted to follow a path, because we needed to go there to kind of, you know, drop part of the artwork. But then obviously you were respecting the area you're in and not running fast and stuff. So that was also something interesting by taking into account the different areas and the different spaces. I felt like you were always checking in which was good.

See, I don't always think just about myself.

And what else? I think those were the most.

You liked it?

Yes, and also seeing the artwork at the end and actually understanding what I did the whole time. I think it's somehow cooler.

Did it meet your expectations?

I mean, it's kind of cool. I guess you can draw different things depending on your level and stuff like that. I mean you can start by drawing a square or a circle. When the drawings start getting complex, it means that you're kind of mastering.

What about the motivation aspect?

The motivation was seeing the outcome. At the beginning I was more motivated because I was trying to understand what I was doing and I was like: okay, this is maybe a letter or this maybe an animal.

Did it make it easier for you? Like, did it change the whole running experience?

I think it did. This is also something that I really like. Sometimes, as a runner or as a pedestrian, you always go to the same areas or run in the same areas. And when you do these type of things, you can also discover new spots or new ways of running within an environment that you already know. So that was also kind of cool. Like, I think I've already lived here for more than a year. And I have never been to these small neighbourhoods. In terms of exploring, it's also cool, I think.

Would you do it again?

I would yeah.

Would you consider preparing the route yourself?

I think I would also like to try to do my own drawing and see how it goes and how it feels, so I can compare both experiences.

I guess the last question. Do you think for people who struggle with motivation and going out running this may be helpful?

I think so. I mean, I feel like you still need to have some running motivation. There are people that just don't like running, just don't enjoy it. So I feel like it does help with the motivation, because you're doing something different and you can always explore your area differently or other areas as well. I guess it could also be helpful if you visit a new city or a new area in your country that you can unlock metaphorically. Maybe even you can get some hints about the city by running. But I guess maybe you can try the routes of other people, what they've already crafted in other cities. I'm thinking of like invisible landmarks. How can you explore a city in a different way with like this invisible traces, invisible landmarks that you follow. And maybe they're also connected to how you can see different sightseeing spots of a city. I'm just thinking about how drawing can also be connected with exploring cities. This could also be a motivation. But I guess you can combine running with different things as well and they can help you to increase the motivation. Depending on your running level you can have a different drawing, it can be more visual way of understanding running in some sort of way.
