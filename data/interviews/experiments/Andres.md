# Andr√©s (we ran together my drawing)

Started running 10 years ago, ran a 10k race, intermediate l

_On GPS-drawings_

Actually, it's the first time. I mean, I knew that people drew with Strava. I knew that was a thing. You know, during Covid I think. But actually I had no clue that a lot of people were doing it. I thought it was just a viral challenge or something on the internet. Not like people doing it really just because.

_On the run itself_

I felt many things. First of all, I was trying to guess what I was doing, trying to connect the dots and understand the patterns of what we're doing. Then I felt really disoriented. I was like: okay I think I'm doing something, and then I'm doing the opposite thing. In my mind it was like: okay, this is odd, this makes no sense and I feel dizzy.

It was interesting, it was something new. Then at one point I felt a bit unsafe, because we were going through some paths that were closer to the road, for example, in a bus sort of lane. I was like: I don't know if this is the best thing to do. I was just thinking, if an algorithm draws a path, then it has to be accurate or safe. But obviously since we were doing it the two of us, we would have each other to check if there was something going on and stuff. Then after that, how did I feel? At one point I was like: okay, is it over? Because sometimes you were slowing down and then changing a bit the pace. But also I found it really nice that you were taking into consideration more residential areas, because we needed to go there to kind of drop part of the artwork. But then obviously you were respecting the area you're in and not running fast and stuff. I felt like you were always checking in, which was good.

_On experience_

I liked it, and also seeing the artwork at the end and actually understanding what I did the whole time. I think it's somehow cooler.

I guess you can draw different things depending on your level and stuff like that. I mean you can start by drawing a square or a circle. When the drawings start getting complex, it means that you're kind of mastering.

The motivation was seeing the outcome. At the beginning I was more motivated because I was trying to understand what I was doing and I was like: okay, this is maybe a letter or this is maybe an animal.

I think it made it easier. This is also something that I really like. Sometimes, as a runner or as a pedestrian, you always go to the same areas or run in the same areas. And when you do these type of things, you can also discover new spots or new ways of running within an environment that you already know. So that was also kind of cool. I think I've already lived here for more than a year. And I have never been to these small neighbourhoods. In terms of exploring, it's also cool, I think.

_On motivation_

I think it may help with motivation. I feel like you still need to have some running motivation. There are people that just don't like running, just don't enjoy it. So I feel like it does help with motivation, because you're doing something different and you can always explore your area differently or other areas as well. I guess it could also be helpful if you visit a new city or a new area in your country that you can unlock metaphorically. Maybe even you can get some hints about the city by running. But I guess maybe you can try the routes of other people, what they've already crafted in other cities. I'm thinking of like invisible landmarks. How can you explore a city in a different way with these invisible traces, invisible landmarks that you follow. I'm just thinking about how drawing can also be connected with exploring cities. This could also be a motivation. But I guess you can combine running with different things as well and they can help you to increase the motivation. Depending on your running level you can have a different drawing, it can be a more visual way of understanding running in some sort of way.

_On running small drawings without a map_

Well, I really enjoyed following the traces that I had in my own mind of the different designs. I feel like you need to be really conscious of what you're doing, because otherwise you mess up the drawing. Also, I feel like it's more suitable for drawing in smaller places than in bigger ones, because you have more control of what you're gonna do.

You're kind of excited about the outcome, which is like the reward, to see how it turned out at the end. And it's not just following something that you already know is gonna work, it's more about enjoying the process, being present about what you're doing and also enjoying the outcome or making fun of the outcome and it's still funny.

I think it could motivate people but the concept should be adjusted so that you can still have control of what you're doing. Because now it's pretty much freestyle. I do feel like it could be helpful. Maybe like for sprints. And also for physical education. I've been seeing here in Geneva that some schools, since they don't have a lot of space in their schools, they go to parks nearby to do physical education and they do actually short runs or short exercises. And the PE teachers they just track their activity. Maybe it could be fun for those exercises.
