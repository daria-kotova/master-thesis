_Before we talk about this, could you please tell a bit about your running experience, when you started, why?_

I think I started running when I was like 15 and it was a way for me to release all of the tension with myself and stuff like that. When I moved to Germany, I think I started doing it way more, because the winter was super harsh. So that was another way of having a strong mind. Sometimes I didn't want to do anything and just stay home, but I kind of pushed myself to do it and go outside. And despite the weather conditions, I would do it just as a way, as a coping mechanism.

_But you still do it?_

No, actually. When I did my internship, I kind of stopped doing it, because it was a new routine for me and everything. I didn't actually do it as much, especially because I was super tired. I would say it's been more than a year that I don't run as frequently. But in summer, I did run like four times, and it was also 7-8k. And now that I was running, I was also thinking about running in the weather conditions. I think it's different when you see the sun and you're enjoying your time. I guess in harsher weather conditions you just need to push yourself to do it or just have certain goals, so that you train for that goal. And then you kind of have your own running routine. But I guess from person to person it's different.

_By goals you mean like training for a race?_

For a race or even like tracking your own statistics or stuff like that.

_Have you ever done a race?_

I have actually, it was like 10k. But it was a really long time ago, I was like 16 or something like this.

_So would you say that you're a beginner or a medium?_

Yeah, really like a beginner. I guess I'm, let's say, intermediate because I think I can push myself a bit more.

_How did you first learn about Strava art or GPS art or this stuff?_

GPS art? Actually it's the first time. I mean, I knew that people drew with Strava. I knew that was a thing. You know, during Covid I think. But actually I had no clue that a lot of people were doing it. I thought it was just a viral challenge or something on the internet. Not like people doing it really just because.

_So tell me how our running experience felt._

I felt many things. First of all, I was trying to guess what I was doing, trying to connect the dots and understand the patterns of what we're doing. Then I felt really disoriented. I was like: okay I think I'm doing something, and then I'm doing the opposite thing. In my mind it was like: okay, this is odd, this makes no sense and I feel dizzy.

_So you didn't like this part?_

No, it was interesting, it was something new. Then at one point I felt a bit unsafe, because we were going through some paths that were closer to the road, for example, in a bus sort of lane. I was like: I don't know if this is the best thing to do.I was just thinking, if an algorithm draws a path, then it has to be accurate or safe. But obviously since we were doing it the two of us, we would have each other to check if there was something going on and stuff. Then after that, how did I feel? At one point I was like: okay, is it over? Because sometimes you were slowing down and then changing a bit the pace. But also I found it really nice that you were taking into consideration more residential areas, because we needed to go there to kind of drop part of the artwork. But then obviously you were respecting the area you're in and not running fast and stuff. I felt like you were always checking in which was good.

_You liked it?_

Yes, and also seeing the artwork at the end and actually understanding what I did the whole time. I think it's somehow cooler.

_Did it meet your expectations?_

I mean, it's kind of cool. I guess you can draw different things depending on your level and stuff like that. I mean you can start by drawing a square or a circle. When the drawings start getting complex, it means that you're kind of mastering.

_What about the motivation aspect?_

The motivation was seeing the outcome. At the beginning I was more motivated because I was trying to understand what I was doing and I was like: okay, this is maybe a letter or this is maybe an animal.

_Did it make it easier for you? Like, did it change the whole running experience?_

I think it did. This is also something that I really like. Sometimes, as a runner or as a pedestrian, you always go to the same areas or run in the same areas. And when you do these type of things, you can also discover new spots or new ways of running within an environment that you already know. So that was also kind of cool. I think I've already lived here for more than a year. And I have never been to these small neighbourhoods. In terms of exploring, it's also cool, I think.

_Would you consider preparing the route yourself?_

I think I would also like to try to do my own drawing and see how it goes and how it feels, so I can compare both experiences.

_Do you think for people who struggle with motivation and going out running this may be helpful?_

I think so. I feel like you still need to have some running motivation. There are people that just don't like running, just don't enjoy it. So I feel like it does help with motivation, because you're doing something different and you can always explore your area differently or other areas as well. I guess it could also be helpful if you visit a new city or a new area in your country that you can unlock metaphorically. Maybe even you can get some hints about the city by running. But I guess maybe you can try the routes of other people, what they've already crafted in other cities. I'm thinking of like invisible landmarks. How can you explore a city in a different way with these invisible traces, invisible landmarks that you follow. I'm just thinking about how drawing can also be connected with exploring cities. This could also be a motivation. But I guess you can combine running with different things as well and they can help you to increase the motivation. Depending on your running level you can have a different drawing, it can be a more visual way of understanding running in some sort of way.

So how did it feel? Well, I really enjoyed following My yeah the the traces that I have in my own mind of the different designs I Feel like you need to be really conscious of what you're doing because otherwise you mess up the drawing and Also, I feel like It's more suitable for Drawing in smaller places Than in bigger places because you have more control of what you're gonna do.

Yeah, and At the same time you do not see what you're doing Yeah, exactly and you're kind of like excited about the Outcome which is like the reward. Oh, yeah, you never know. Yes, exactly. And then this is like the sort of like the reward at the end like to see how How it turned out at the end and it's not just following something that it you already know that it's gonna work it's more about Enjoying the process being present about what you're doing and also enjoying the outcome or Making fun of the outcome and it's still funny Yeah,

two of the outcomes are good What about like what did you like more like running alone or running together and trying to do something together? I feel like both Have positive aspects like when you're wrong when you run by your own you are Enjoying yourself and then just like Following that path in your mind and when you run with another person It's not just about having the path in your mind, but also about checking in Like checking making check -ins on the other person so that you are both on the same page and can synchronize Yeah,

okay, so I feel like it's a bit more complicated when you do it with someone cuz it adds the level of Checking the other person then there's a more fun. I Feel like both are fun. Okay. Would you do it again?

I would do that. Yeah Okay, but would you consider it as a motivation for running or not really? I think it could motivate people but The concept should be adjusted so that you can still have Control of what you're doing and I just just because now it's pretty much Freestyle, yes So I like in this current state can it be helpful or I do feel like it could be helpful Maybe like for sprints.

Yes, and also like for physical education I feel just like I've been Seeing here in Geneva that some schools since they don't have a lot of space in their schools they go to like parks nearby to do physical education and they do actually short runs or short exercises and the PE teachers they just Track their activity and stuff like that and maybe it could be fun for those Yeah with those exercises Do you have anything else to add?

No. Okay. Thank you for your interview
