_On how he first learnt anout GPS-drawings_

I have seen this randomly on the internet, people doing drawings. I remember during the pandemic, they had found this.. I'm not sure if you familiar with the movie "2001: a space Odyssey". So, you know, that monolith from from the movie. And they found one of those shiny things in Arizona, not sure if you had caught that. Essentially, they found this metal object that looked like a monolith in "2001: a space Odyssey" in the middle of nowhere. You know, nature, desert Arizona. And it was kind of cool. I don't know, I just got inspired, like: hey, I'm gonna go and run this monolith in San Francisco. So that was the first one.

_On his drawings_

I think I did the heart for Valentine's Day. And then the third one, the ribbo. There's a custom called Martisor. It's like on March 1st, it's kind of beginning of spring and it's just like a ribbon. That's the traditional thing that's given for this holiday. So yeah, I tried to draw that.

And then the fourth one, that's kind of this Hilbert curve for mathematics. Essentially, you can make multiple iterations of this that get denser and denser. And then if you go to infinity, it fills up the whole space. So I just thought it was a cool idea. There was somebody who during the pandemic created this website called "tiny little loops", I think. Where the idea was that you're supposed to only stay in your neighborhood. So he was trying to run a lot, but in small areas. And he thought about doing this thing where you would draw a shape that doesn't intersect with itself. So if you want a loop, start from one point and end at the same point without having any intersections. And I thought this might be a good way to do that. So that's why I ended up doing this. I came up with the idea to do that curve, which was very challenging. Well, it works on the grid of San Francisco, but some streets are kind of closed. So it was really challenging to find the exact place where this could happen, because that shape is so specific, you cannot change anything about it. Otherwise it just doesn't work. So every street part of that curve had to be open so I could like run over it.

It was mostly driven by the cause. I had the idea that I want to do this, and then I did it.

_On running for a cause_

In a way, even the one on Valentine's day, I guess, it was dedicated to a cause. And March 1st, the Martisor, they were kind of both causes. I guess not very personal causes, maybe.

The one with the piece sign, there was a lot of unrest about the Ukraine war. There were some peaceful silent protests here in San Francisco. And I forgot exactly how I came up with the idea, but I thought it would be kind of a fun way to show my support. I think in particular for this one, I realized I made a lot of mistakes during the run. I actually thought it was a good metaphor for peace, that it wasn't really a perfect sign. It was hell of a lot of other things.

Lina is a lot more personal. So there's a colleague from high school who has a kid who has this genetic disease, CDKL5 disorder. And I think it was three years ago, maybe the first time where during the month of June they had this thing where there's a donor who matches miles. So whatever you recorded as walks, runs, hikes, you recorded it on the platform and then each mile is matched to $1 donated by this person and up to something like 20 000 miles. So then it's both raising awareness and direct donations to that campaign, but also tracking these miles and having the donor kind of match them with the monetary donation.

So, I think it was a third year this year that I've done that. And I kind of realized how much this is particularly tough for the parents, because it's just like the way the disease is, it's very hard to communicate with them. We were kind of a group of three colleagues of us doing these runs every day. And I just thought it was a very nice way to kind of show my support. And I got the idea. I want to write this. I had the picture in my head. It should be a cursive font. And I pretty much had the exact same idea that you see there. These sorts of things are actually very difficult to find the right streets to do them on, because you only make it very large and then it doesn't really matter because you can find streets. But then if you want to make it small, it's very hard to make it legible. So that was extremely challenging. Plus San Francisco has hills. So if you want to make it look nice, you're going to have to take all of those hills. So this ended up being ridiculously long and also a lot of elevation. But then, you know, once I actually got something that I was happy with, I didn't know exactly how long it would be. I had an idea and I created the actual route, street by street, and I saw how long it was and I was like: I'm not going to change it now. And I wasn't going to cut short even, you know, the last piece from the A. If I run that much, I might as well run all of it. So it ended up being a very good training run for me.

It was some motivation to run more, but I could also send a message. So I think that was the general idea. I could send the message with my runs and show support for something and also get the extra motivation for myself because you know, once I set up to do this, I wasn't going to stop in the middle. So this was a really challenging training run, but in the end I'm also benefiting.

And what was nice about this one is my friend from that group who was also supporting the cause decided to send this message in other cities as well, because we were all in different cities. So she created smaller kind of lina texts in different cities for her aunt to run.She ran one.So this message got replicated three times.

_On planning_

You know, it's just another way to express yourself. There's both the planning aspects, but then you have to execute it. So you can plan some really grandiose design, but then who's gonna run it? So you have to plan something that's within your capability to run. So that makes it very interesting, that you have to trade off the artistic expression with your ability and time, and all of that. So it's an interesting problem.

You can just draw it on the map, but then in a way, the value of this is to actually go out and write. You drew it on the map and you know how it's going to look like. But then when you run it, somehow it gets extra value from that. And I don't know where it comes from.

_On motivation_

I pretty much exclusively run outside. I never run on treadmill. You run outside, you go out, and then you have to come back. On the treadmill, you could always say stop, and then there's no motivation to continue. But with these drawings, you set out this goal, and then you do it halfway, and even if it becomes really tough, you still want to finish it.
