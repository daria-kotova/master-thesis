_On competition run_

Saysky was running a Strava art competition during Covid lockdowns with a prize of a pair of socks ( small scale competition ðŸ˜‚) - from recall on their insta, all the other entries were individual and a lot more elaborate. Lazyboys organised for a group one - someone had the idea of what to do, then you signed up to run a specific letter and shared your screen shot, which I then pulled together into that

Weâ€™d done something similar in my London run club - but here it was in place of a cancelled relay running event during Covid, and a few more rules to it - eg we had to replicate certain distances (maybe 10km/10 miles?) or so to get the cumulative distance of the cancelled race.

For both, it was a really nice way of keeping a sense of team and community through the lockdowns - and meant people could participate from no matter where they were in the world

_On motivation_

Hmmm Iâ€™m not sure. I guess people who run anyway often focus on time/distance goals, which Strava art doesnâ€™t do, so it might mix it up.

Personally - for one of the two, I remember it being more a case of how to fit it in alongside the specific training sessions I was doing that week, and for the other, I wanted to run anyway so it gave me a reason to run in a specific place that I wouldnâ€™t usually, which keeps it interesting.

For both of those it wasnâ€™t a new motivation to run, but more motivated by the reaction afterwards to the Strava art - being part of something bigger and the sense of responsibility to thwart club etc.
