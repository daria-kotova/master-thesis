_On how he learnt about GPS-drawings_

I think it was quite common for people like me to find strava art, and it was really just because of COVID. I'm working from home all the time and I'm in a running group. We were allowed to go for runs with other people, so we could meet up with people. But, you know, when you're in a group of people who are serious runners, they really depend on the community for group runs. But since they were all sort of banned, but you could still meet up with people and go for a run, I think we were just looking for something different to do. I think we were just bored really. I think somebody in the group had heard about it and done a couple just for fun. And to be honest, I thought it was really silly and I never thought I would do it. But I also had this weird strange feeling that i would be good at it. I finally came around to trying it because it was lockdown and we were looking for activities to do with the kids. And so we took out a map and we just started tracing lines on the map to see what we could find. But then I started doing it to make jokes. And then I just got hooked.

I still do it now. I started in 2020, I guess, and I still do it all the time. It's become like doodling. I do it when I'm trying to relax. You know, if I was talking to you, for example, I might just pull up a map and just kind of look at it. In a weird way it helps me focus actually. Have you ever been in class taking notes and you just need to kind of occupy your hands in a way. That's what it is for me. And so a lot of times I'm on a call and I'll just pull up a map and draw something. And now I've got thousands and thousands and thousands of either drawings that are finished or drawings that are almost finished or drawings that are just really bad.

_On group GPS-drawings and competitions_

Well, I'm at a point now where I can't possibly run all the ones that I've drawn. So I started to send them to people to do, and a lot of times people ask me to do something in another city and I do them for that. But I see them as two separate things. There are some that I'm really proud of the actual art. And then there're some that I'm just really proud of the run itself, because it's a fun route in London, or I saw some cool things where I run with a friend. And so I started organizing a lot of the runs, just specifically to meet up with people.

During COVID we had all these opportunities to run with groups of six or a group of one, and so we did a relay. That was a relay race with 50 people. So, we started at the green dot. Two people ran the head and then after about 10k, I gave two other people a time to meet us at that point and then they met us at that point and then they did another 10 or 15k and then they met another two people. Because at the time we were allowed to run with another person. I think we did it in 20 stages.

So this was also a group run, but with this one, I actually ran the whole thing. However, everybody else ran a section of it. And we made it into a competition. I think another 50 people did this run, but they each did a section of this. And then I went around and I found all these sort of things on the road, like easter eggs. And I took a photo of something. And then I asked people to look for that as they went around. And then we made up these silly rules. And we made the run into like a game. And it was all about like, who took the best photo. I set a bunch of segments on Strava. And, you could run a segment really fast. And then afterwards, we have an award ceremony. And it was really silly, but really fun. For me, in the beginning, it wasn't about the art itself, it was more about keeping people occupied during COVID and finding a way to have some fun. That's what initially drew me to it.

So I always thought, it was funny. I never really took it seriously. I always wanted to make a joke. I was never really trying to make good art.

We're all runners, all of a sudden we're not able to compete, you know, nobody's able to race because all the races have been canceled. But we were all very well trained and ready to go for. It was right at the beginning of marathon season and so we were all just really bored and we wanted to run. So I made these. I mean that's what they were. They were just these fake competitions where you know, your time was part of the equation. I had all these different metrics and I made up all these weighting criteria where you could run fast, but it didn't really matter, unless you took a good selfie. We had like this judging panel and we were just being really silly. It was a lot of fun. I think in the end we did about seven or eight of these sort of group runs.

_On how he started enjoying the creative side of it_

But then, eventually I started really finding the process of drawing really satisfying. The, you know, being able to complete these things. I just finished one the other day and I was like: wow, it's really good. How was that just there all this time?

And, you know, they're really not easy to do. They're like solving a puzzle. And sometimes I spend many, many months on a drawing. I know that there's something there. I found the basic shape and the basic outline. But it just takes forever to get it to a point where I'm happy with it.

And just like anything else that you do. You do something and it's just an idea or a concept. And then you revisit it and then at some point you get frustrated because you're not making any progress on it. And then it's because you realize that you just need to take a step back. And then a few weeks later or even a month later, you go: oh, I'll just do that. And then you just kind of strip away. So at some point I became really into that process. Like you would do anything else. Like if you're writing something that's important to you, you write some notes, you read it, you hate it, you edit it, you, you write it again. You go back and do some more research. And so it just became like that for a lot of different things.

I've been working on one now for like, it's going to be great, but I've been working on it for nearly a year now. But it's not like every day. At one point I worked on it nonstop for like a whole day. I just couldn't get it anywhere. And then I revisit it every now and then. And I know it's going to be good, and actually I'm done with it now. But then you go: actually, now that I've done it, how am I going to find the time to actually, to run it?

_On drawing animals_

Animals are, I think the only thing that really, really works on Strava. It's all about scale. On a big enough map, you can draw whatever you want. But I can't run that scale. And the only thing that works in a running scale are very, very simple shapes. The only people who do anything else are doing it on a bigger scale. There're people who do portraits that look nice, but they would not be possible on a running scale. They're only possible when you're talking about two or 300 kilometers or at least a hundred kilometers.

I live in london and it's not a good city but it's a very good city for Strava art. There's lots of these wonderfully curved lines and sections of grids. It's a really great city for drawing but it's also limiting in a way. But on a big american grid city if you started at a scale where you just committed to drawing more than 50k, you can pretty much draw whatever you want.

I think it's just because everybody knows what an animal looks like. The worst thing that can happen is if you draw something and people say: what is that? You're limited, even when you get the scale quite big. Strava is a one -line thing, so you can't do anything. You can't join up two things without there being a line connecting them. So every time I'm drawing something and I think there's something interesting there and I want to do something really detailed to make it work, it never works, because at some point it just has to be simple for it to look good on the screen. I think that's why I do animals. Also just because that's where I started, that's what the joke was always about.

_On Gustavo_

He runs on a sand dune and he can do whatever he wants. This is a different thing and it's not cheating. It's a different creative process. He decides what to draw and then he figures out how to go draw it and then put that map onto the dune, create a GPX track out of it to follow it. So his process is entirely different than my process. I don't set out to draw anything, I look for shapes. I never wake up and say I'm gonna draw a lion today. That's just not how it works. What happens is I see a shape, I see something that looks interesting, like the way a street goes. And I start to play around it and I just see where that goes. It's a very different thing. And also, I think sometimes he draws his own art, but mostly what he does is he takes an image of something and traces that and then applies it. It's not his art. And I don't mean to diminish it. What he does is really cool, it's really clever and people really respond to it. So it's just different. And I would say the same thing about what a lot of us do. I think what cyclists do, for example, is different and it's because of the scale. If I can run 20k, a cyclist can cycle 80k without any problems. So the people who ride a bike, they're doing a little bit like Gustavo is doing it. They have something in mind that they want to do and then they just go do it, because they have the scale. But that is not what runners do. Runners or people who think in terms of between 10 miles and 30 miles, they have to be able to do it within that scale. And I think that's why we end up doing a lot of animals, because it's the only thing that really works on that scale, that looks like a drawing.

_On GPS-drawings for a cause_

I did the Grenfell tower memorial (fire in the 24-floor Grenfell Tower block of flats in London, June 2017), where I drew a bunch of hearts. And I gave those hearts to the community who was affected by the fire. And then they ran them. It was really just to remember the disaster and get people together. I was really proud of that one, but it was very simple.

And then, the reindeer run. Another guy who runs that charity asked me to help. And so I drew a bunch of reindeer and I gave them to people who wanted to run one. And then I asked everybody to donate money to the cause. So we raised a little bit of money, not a lot. It wasn't just me, I think some other people in London also. I don't know his name, but on Instagram it's routeopia. So he organized it and asked me to draw some reindeer. And I gave those around. Actually, I hope we do it again this year because I ended up doing a lot of reindeer.

There's another guy Jeric, which you probably heard of. He's another guy in London and his primary motivation is using Strava art for helping people. And he's managed to raised a lot of money for it.

Somebody in an animal conservation program asked me to draw some giraffes to help raise money. They try to rescue and support the giraffes in Africa. I'm drawing a bunch of giraffes, and hopefully we'll get some people to run them and raise some money.

_On motivation_

I think there have been times where it has been really motivated. You run for different reasons, right? You run because you want to lose some weight. You run because, you know, just general fitness. You run because you're bored. Or then you start to run because you want to get better and race.

Now, when I was training for a marathon, I didn't really want to do any Strava art. But if you're not training for something, it can be hard to get out the door just to go for a run. So what motivates people is connecting, meeting people. When you're not training for anything, you have to find a different reason. And sometimes for me that reason actually has been to do a drawing.

There's a lady in our group and she was having a hard time doing her long runs during her training for a marathon. And she asked me to draw a bunch of routes for her, and that motivated her. Cause when you start to train for a half marathon or a marathon, you know, Sunday rolls around, you're tired and the schedule says you got to go to 15, 20 K and you're just bored of the same route. When you have somebody plan a route for you, your mind isn't on the run. Your mind is on the map and you're still getting the aerobic workout. So I would say that GPS does motivate me to run. And I know that it motivates other people to run. But when when I'm training for a marathon, I am much more by the book. Like, I want to do the miles, I want my mind to be on my pace. So I'm very routine based when I'm training.

_On elephants_

An elephant, in my opinion, is the easiest thing to draw. I don't really know, but I think it's because they're so big. It's one of the very few things where I can actually just sit down and say: I'm going to draw an elephant, and I can actually draw an elephant. Most of the other animals, they don't work out that way.

If you ever get to London and want to run an elephant, I've literally got, I don't know, maybe a hundred elephants. There's a lot of elephants out there, they're everywhere.

## Conversation on Instagram

_When reflecting on GPS-drawings being art_

It’s all art. What I have found is that, like with any art, sometimes you like it and sometimes you don’t. I don’t like the art when a cyclist does a drawing that is 200k because I know that’s easy. But other people think it’s amazing because they just see the result. There’s really only two cyclists that I think are artistic. That’s Anthony Hoyte and Christian Ohantel. If you compare any of their drawings, which are mostly all over 200k, to any others who are cycling those distances, you can see they are better. But, if you can draw an elephant under 20k and people can tell it’s an elephant that’s more interesting to me. It’s much harder to do. Ask the cyclists if they can draw anything recognisable in less than 20 k. I don’t think they could. Likewise, one of the most famous Strava artists is a guy in San Francisco. The city is a giant grid and his drawings are almost all more than 80k. On that scale on a grid, you can draw almost anything you want. And often, his drawings are just tracings of other drawings. People like it so that’s art in its own way but I don’t like it.

Some art is more accessible to more people. If a non Strava art aficionado saw what I drew for you and compared it to what Gustavo does or Lenny in SF does there’s no question they would be more impressed by Gustavo\Lenny. But if you know you know.

The drawings we do make people happy and inspire people. And many people try and can’t do it. So, it must be art. But we all like what we like. I still find it hard to consider myself an artist because that’s not what got me into it. But, how I use it to connect with people and make jokes is artistic it it’s own way. I have a WhatsApp group where we’re laughing all the time.

_On what can be considered a GPS-drawing_

I have dozens of drawings that I’m really happy about and think are my best work but I don’t think they are real until they have actually been run/cycled. I don’t know for sure but there is someone in Taiwan who’s is doing drawings all the time that are really good but I’m not 100% sure he is actually running them and I just can’t see him as an artist. It’s a draft until you do it. Or get someone to do it for you.

You running that lion brought me a lot of joy. I was really happy with the drawing itself but it’s just not real until someone runs it. It doesn’t have to be me. Someone else just ran one of my routes in London and it’s the same joy. It’s like the routes just aren’t finished until someone runs them.

_On Strav.art account_

I think a big part of the problem is the main source of Strava art.

I’ve come to think since this guy has the biggest microphone, he should do more to regulate these kinds of things. He’s just one guy and it seems like he is now just motivated by likes, which I get, but he really is a gatekeeper. He does NOT categorise, or publish distances clearly. And he clearly favours cyclists, because he is one. And favours people with lots of followers. He knows, for example that what the Swiss guy does is more impressive but he doesn’t recognise him often.
