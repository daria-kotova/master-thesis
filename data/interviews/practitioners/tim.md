_How did you learn about Strava art at first?_

I think it was quite common for people like me to find strava art, and it was really just because of COVID. I'm working from home all the time and I'm in a running group. We were allowed to go for runs with other people, so we could meet up with people. But, you know, when you're in a group of people who are serious runners, they really depend on the community for group runs. But since they were all sort of banned, but you could still meet up with people and go for a run, I think we were just looking for something different to do. I think we were just bored really. I think somebody in the group had heard about it and done a couple just for fun. And to be honest I thought it was really silly and I never thought i would do it. But I also had this weird strange feeling that i would be good at it. I finally came around to trying it because it was lockdown and we were looking for activities to do with the kids. And so we took out a map and we just started tracing lines on the map to see what we could find. But then i started doing it to make jokes. And then I just got hooked.

I still do it now. I started in 2020, I guess, and I still do it all the time. It's become like doodling. I do it when I'm trying to relax. You know, if I was talking to you, for example, I might just pull up a map and just kind of look at it. In a weird way it helps me focus actually. Have you ever been in class taking
notes and you just need to kind of occupy your hands in a way. That's what it is for me. And so a lot of times I'm on a call and I'll just pull up a map and draw something. And now I've got thousands and thousands and thousands of either drawings that are finished or drawings that are almost finished or drawings that are just really bad.

_Do you like more the process of doodling and creating a Strava art route or running it and finishing?_

Well, I'm at a point now where I can't possibly run all the ones that I've drawn. So I started to send them to people to do, and a lot of times people ask me to do something in another city and I do them for that. But I see them as two separate things. There are some that I'm really proud of the actual art. And then there're some that I'm just really proud of the run itself, because it's a fun route in London, or I saw some cool things where I run with a friend. And so I started organizing a lot of the runs, just specifically to meet up with people.

During COVID we had all these opportunities to run with groups of six or a group of one, and so we did all these group runs together, and so we did a relay. That was a relay race with 50 people. So, so we started at the green dot. Two people ran the head and then after about 10k, I gave two other people a time to meet us at that point and then they met us at that point and then they did another 10 or 15k and then they met another two people. Because at the time we were allowed to run with another person. I think we did it in 20 stages. So I did that one. That was one of the group runs we did.

So this this was also a group run, but with this one, I actually ran the whole thing. However, everybody else ran a section of it. And we made it into a competition. I think another 50 people did this run, but they each did a section of this. And then I went around and I found all these sort of things on the road, like easter eggs. And I took a photo of something. And then I asked people to look for that as they went around. And then we made up these silly rules. And we made the run into like a game. And it was like all about like, who took the best photo. I set a bunch of segments on Strava. And, you could run a segment really fast. And then afterwards, we have an award ceremony. And it was really silly, but really fun. For me, in the beginning, it wasn't about the art itself, it was more about keeping people occupied during COVID and finding a way to have some fun. That's what initially drew me to it.

So I always thought, it was funny. I never really took it seriously. I always wanted to make a joke. I was never really trying to make good art.

We're all runners, all of a sudden we're not able to compete, you know, nobody's able to race because all the races have been canceled. But we were all very well trained and ready to go for. It was right at the beginning of marathon season and so we were all just really bored and we wanted to run. So I made these. I mean that's what they were. They were just these fake competitions where you know, your time was part of the equation. I had all these different metrics and I made up all these weighting criteria where you could run fast, but it didn't really matter, unless you took a good selfie. We had like this judging panel and we were just being really silly. It was a lot of fun. I think in the end we did about seven or eight of these sort of group runs.

But then, eventually I started really finding the process of drawing really satisfying. The, you know, being able to complete these things. I just finished one the other day and I was like: wow, it's really good. How was that just there all this time?

And, you know, they're really not easy to do. They're like solving a puzzle. And sometimes I spend many, many months on a drawing. I know that there's something there. I found the basic shape and the basic outline. But it just takes forever to get it to a point where I'm happy with it.

And just like anything else that you do. You do something and it's just an idea or a concept. And then you revisit it and then at some point you get frustrated because you're not making any progress on it. And then it's because you realize that you just need to take a step back. And then a few weeks later or even a month later, you go: oh, I'll just do that. And then you just kind of strip away.So at some point I became really into that process. Like you would do anything else. Like if you're writing something that's important to you, you write some notes, you read it, you hate it, you edit it, you, you write it again. You go back and do some more research. And so it just became like that for a lot of different things.

I've been working on one now for like, it's going to be great, but I've been working on it for nearly a year now. But it's not like every day. At one point I worked on it nonstop for like a whole day. I just couldn't get it anywhere. And then I revisit it every now and then. And I know it's going to be good, and actually I'm done with it now. But then you go: actually, now that I've done it, how am I going to find the time to actually, to run it?

_Now you mostly do animals?_

Animals are, I think the only thing that really, really works on Strava. It's all about scale. On a big enough map, you can draw whatever you want. But I can't run that scale. And the only thing that works in a running scale are very, very simple shapes. The only people who do anything else are doing it on a bigger scale. There're people who do portraits that look nice, but they would not be possible on a running scale. They're only possible when you're talking about two or 300 kilometers or at least a hundred kilometers.

I live in london and it's not a good city but it's a very good city for Strava art. There's lots of these wonderfully curved lines and sections of grids. It's a really great city for drawing but it's also limiting in a way. Bbut on a big american grid city if you started at a scale where you just committed to drawing more than fifty k, you can pretty much draw whatever you want.

I think it's just because everybody knows what an animal looks like. The worst thing that can happen is if you draw something and people say: what is that?You're limited. Even though when you get the scale quite big. Strava is a one -line thing, so you can't do anything. You can't join up two things without there being a line connecting them.So every time I'm drawing something and I think there's something interesting there and I want to do something really detailed to make it work, It never works, because at some point it just has to be simple for it to look good on the screen. I think that's why I do animals. Also just because that's where I started, that's what the joke was always about.

_Wnen talking about Gustavo_

He runs on a sand dune and he can do whatever he wants. This is a different thing and it's not cheating. It's a different creative process. He decides what to draw and then he figures out how to go draw it and then put that map onto the dune, create a GPX track out of it to follow it. So his process is entirely different than my process. I don't set out to draw anything, I look for shapes. I never wake up and say I'm gonna draw a lion today. That's just not how it works. What happens is I see a shape, I see something that looks interesting, like the way a street goes. And I start to play around it and I just see where that goes. It's a very different thing. And also, I think sometimes he draws his own art, but mostly what he does is he takes an image of something and traces that and then applies it. It's not his art. And I don't mean to diminish it. What he does is really cool, it's really clever and people really respond to it. So it's just different. And I would say the same thing about what a lot of us do. I think what cyclists do, for example, is different and it's because of the scale. If I can run 20k, a cyclist can cycle 80k without any problems. So the people who ride a bike, they're doing a little bit like Gustavo is doing it. They have something in mind that they want to do and then they just go do it, because they have the scale. But that is not what runners do. Runners or people who think in terms of between 10 miles and 30 miles, they have to be able to do it within that scale. And I think that's why we end up doing a lot of animals, because it's the only thing that really works on that scale, that looks like a drawing.

_When talking about his Strava artist nomination_

So that was on a bike, actually, because I was injured. And I just wanted to do something really big. And a couple of times I wanted to just kind of point out that you can do whatever you want once you start thinking on a bigger scale.

_Do you like more GPS art made by running or by cycling?_

I see them as separate things. I find them to be more satisfying when I've run them. Because it's harder. The getting a run done, I find that to be much more rewarding than getting one done on a bike, because of all those things that I've told you, it's like, it's almost too easy. When you start to draw on around 200 kilometers, it just becomes really easy. Also physically, when you're running, you're running, you're looking at a map, you're following the directions, but you're running, it is actually running to get it done. When you're cycling, I would say that you're not really getting any exercise. I mean very very very very basic exercise. wWhen you cycle, you have to slow down, so that you can make all the turns that you have to make. You're not getting your heart rate high. So physically you're just out there to do the drawing. Because you're going so much faster on the bike and because you're turning so often, at that point you're not cycling for fitness, you're just out on a long bike ride, where you're constantly stopping and starting. But on a run you have just more time to see you when the next turn is and make sure you're getting it right. But you're still running, you're still doing your easy pace and you're still getting around it. So I would say that just they're just more satisfying running.

_On doing something similar to Gustavo's practice_

So he inspired me to do what I thought was impossible. So I run in this group called the Queens Park Harriers, which is my local running group. And people had asked me to do our run club logo. And it was impossible because it's letters.

It's only 5.65 kilometers, and at that scale you could never draw something this detailed when you're constricted by the streets. So I drew this, and I think I even talked to Gustavo about how he did it to make this work. I invited everybody to come and run the route. And so this is where I think what Gustavo does is really cool.

It was one of the hardest things I ever did. So I set up this, I set up a tent in the middle of this field and I invited all these other runners to come in and I sent them the map and I said: you'll win points if you do this, this and this. And so they all came and they ran this and they did a terrible, terrible job. Really, really, really, really bad. You can get points for being extra silly and it was just this big laugh.

But the only way you could actually do this is by walking it. It's impossible to run this. And that's why Gustavo isn't running it. He's just out on that dune and he's watching every step he takes and making sure that every step he takes is on that track. And if you look at his statistics, he's out there for hours and hours and hours. It is really not easy to do. And I can tell you because everybody that tried it. So this is not perfect, but mine was by far the best.

I think a lot of people don't even realize that they're two completely different things. What he does is very very different, his process is totally different, the rules are very different. But most people just don't know. And most people don't know that you cycling is a different thing than running. I think the best ones are less than 20k. And I think it's really hard to do anything that looks like something if it's less than 20k.

I think that if you ask me to draw a dog or a lion, I don't think I could draw one with a pen and pencil better than I can do one on a map.

_So you said that you started GPS art just for fun. But I saw in your post that you also do some events to support something. There was a reindeer run for children with cancer._

yeah that's that's right so um that's right so i think i think there's like i think that is for me like the next sort of if i continue to do something like this it's uh so i've done i've done two um i did the grand feld the grand feld tower memorial um where i drew a bunch of hearts um and i gave those hearts to the community who was affected by the fire and then and then they ran that one and it was it was it was really just to sort of like you know remember the remember the disaster and like you know get people together so that was really i was really proud of that one and then but it was very simple and then the one that you're talking about actually is um a ranger the reindeer run how did that work um so i didn't i contributed to um another guy asked me another guy who ran who runs that charity asked me to help and so i drew a bunch of reindeer and i gave them to people who wanted to run one

Mm -hmm.

that and then and then I asked I asked everybody to donate money to the to the cause so we raised a little bit of money not a lot but his it wasn't just me I think I think some other people in London also I don't know his name but on Instagram is rootopia I think R -O -U -T -O -P -I -A rootopia so he organized it asked me to draw some reindeer and I gave those around of this and actually I hope I hope we do it again this year because I ended up doing a lot of reindeer I grew a lot of reindeer but the other there's another guy Jarek which you probably probably heard of Jarek he's a he's another guy he's another guy in London and he he probably his primary motivation I mean you have to ask him because I've only met him once but on Instagram it looks like his primary motivation is using Strava art for for helping helping people and he's managed to raised a lot of money for it but I think I've always wanted to kind of figure out how to do how to do that and it's it's identical what else have I done there like that actually oh actually somebody just asked me to do so I'm drawing somebody asked me somebody in a you know in an animal conservation program asked me to draw some giraffes to help raise money for and I can't remember the name of the group but they just to rescue or supports the giraffe the drafts in Africa and so there's a group in London that that is Ross I'm drawing a bunch of giraffes and hopefully we'll get some people to draw to run them and raise some money

Thanks.

Mm -hmm. What was the name of this guy? Jericho?

Get J -E -R -I -C and then his last name is Y -U -E -N.

Oh wait, is it like the code something, code runner? Yes, exactly. Oh yeah, I'm following him. Yeah, it's okay.

So he's really, I don't know, so he was able to, so he's also a London bass, but you'll see, but I think, so because he's in a lot of, he's in a lot of big running groups here, so he had like a lot of exposure, and I think he started right at the beginning of, I think he started quite early in this, and because he connected to, I think he was really smart because he connected to that sort of, he connected the Strava art to helping raise money for people,

and I think that really worked. I think he did a really good job sort of marketing himself, but, and if you look at what he does, like that's really his motivating factor. I mean, mine was not that, his was always,

yeah and uh like if we talk about motivation but more like motivation for running do you think GPS art is something that may help with it i mean it sounds like for you like you don't really have problems with motivation you're running just for fun and doing it for fun what about other people

I think there have been times where it has been really motivated.

Mmm.

to run because it's uh, a drawing, um, I think, I think with running, so are you a runner? Sorry, I haven't even, are you um

Well, yeah, I'm actually preparing for my first half marathon and I find that GPS art actually helps to run when I don't want to run.

So I, I think about this a lot and there's times where if you're running, you know, running, you know, this, I've been running for a long time. I've been running for like 15 years now and I've been running for in that time.

You run for different reasons, right? You, you run because you want to lose some weight. You run because you, you want to, um, you know, just general fitness. You run because you're, you're bored or then you start to run because you want to get better and race.

Now, when I was training for a marathon, I didn't really want to do any. Strava art, but if you're not training for something, it's, it can be, it can be hard to get out the door, just to, just to go for a run without real, at different times in your life, like you don't, um, you don't really want to just go for a, just go for a run.

So what motivates people is, you know, connecting, meeting people when you're not training for anything, you have, you have to find a different reason. And, and, and sometimes for me, that reason actually has been to do a drawing.

Um, uh, and, uh, I think, uh, and then there's also times where like, so there's a lady in our group and, uh, she was having a hard time doing her long runs during her training for a, for a marathon.

And she asked me to draw a bunch of roots for her and, and that motivated her. Um, just, you know, cause when you just, when you start to train for a half marathon or a marathon, you know, Sunday rolls around, you're tired and the schedule says you got to go to 15, 20 K and you're just bored of the same route and you're just, you're, you're, you're tired when you, when you have like, you know, somebody plans a roof for you and somebody,

you know, you're gonna, you, your mind isn't on the run. Your mind is on the map and like, you know, just kind of, it's, it's, you're still getting the aerobic workout. So I, I would say that, I would say that, uh, GPS does motivate me to run.

And I know that it motivates other people to run. I know that the art does help, uh, but when I'm trained personally, when I'm training for a marathon, I am much more by the book, like, like I want to do the miles, I want to, I want to, I want my mind to be on my pace and my, and my, um, so I'm, I'm very routine based when I'm training.

Like when I do, when I do like a marathon training program, I do the same run in the same place, the same time. And then when the weekend rolls around, I do the same long run, same place, same time. So during marathon training, I'm less inclined to do Strava art, but, um, just like right now, like I would much rather go out for a, to run like a dog or something, then they just do like a boring old dog around the neighborhood.

But you are not bored when you prepare for marathon and doing the same stuff every week.

but but but the motivation for me running a marathon is is there are people who run marathons just to just to do it they don't care about their time they don't but when I when I finally get to when I finally get committed to running a marathon I'm doing it because I want to push myself I want to go faster than I had done before and so the motivation for me is is doing the training so that I'm prepared for that and I think you know I think maybe that's that's not always healthy but like for me like I feel better on a marathon day when I've done the when I've done the work and I know that my you know my body can can can do that but with GPS running I I'm just not focused And I,

you know, if I, and sometimes they're quite long, so you don't want to run too long because it's not good for your body, right? So sometimes I'll walk a little bit and I'm just, and also you're always getting lost and you're always like, you know, you just don't want to miss the turn and so like you're always checking the map and you're always, so I just go much, much slower than I would if I was running for training or even just for a normal run.

I go much, much slower than on a GPS run.

Mm -hmm.

Yeah. So I have, I think I have just one little question left. What is delirium challenge? It's something with elephants.

Oh my goodness, I love this one so much. I love this so much. So it was actually like, I think it was last year at the end of the summer last year, I think. So, you know, all these people, there's a lot of people that do like straw bar competitions, right?

They announce something on, you know, their website, this is straw bar competition. And run this drawing, you know. So the delirium challenge was a beer company in Belgium, who their logo is an elephant.

And so the delirium challenge was to run an elephant. And they said, like, you have to run the elephant between this date and that date. And, you know, the winner gets a, you know, they listed a bunch of prizes and some of the prizes were pretty good.

Now, I thought it was funny. Again, this is because I think this is really funny. So first of all, an elephant, if you ever wanted, have you ever drawn a straw bar? Have you ever done straw bar? Yeah.

What have you drawn?

like a heart, a fish, like a profile of a man and I have prepared like a head of a cat and that's it. But it's very like basic and short distances.

I don't really know because they have a trunk, but I think it's because they're so big. I don't know what it is, but for me, I can draw an elephant. It's one of the very few things where I can actually just sit down and I can say, I'm going to draw an elephant, and I can actually draw an elephant.

Most of the other animals, they don't work out that way, but I don't know what it is about elephants. Anyway, so the delirium challenge, they posted this saying, they said, draw an elephant. I can't exactly remember this, but I'm in this local running group, and somebody said, they said, Tim, have you seen this delirium challenge?

You've got to run an elephant between this day and that day. But in the fine print on their website, it said, only eligible if you live in Belgium.

Mm -hmm.

thing is right like if you if you if a bunch of people just draw draw an elephant or an elephant and they give the prize in the end to a really bad elephant it's gonna look really bad so like I do I do it's so weird that I've never explained this to anybody because I'm in a running group where we we joke about this stuff all the time like in the in the I'm in a big running group but in that within that running group I'm in a little running group like a strong hard running group where we where we make where we make we know we we make jokes about about all this and so anyway the joke was even though you had to be indulgent to win we knew that we knew that any elephant that we did here in London would be better than what they did in Belgium just because just because of the scale and we just anyway so what I did I drew like I do like 50 elephants maybe even more I can't remember and I said anybody wants to run an elephant here's a bunch of elephants I posted all the elephants drawings and I think we ran like 20 20 elephants or something

Mm -hmm.

And I ran at least three of them, I think. And then the beer company just said, once you finish running your elephant, just tag us. And that's exactly what happened. Everybody that belched it, I did want.

It sounds really cocky, but they just weren't very good. And then every one that my club did, that I drew, was good. And so I knew that we would win. And then that they would have to change their competition because they couldn't give first prize.

So what they ended up doing was they just ended up giving everybody the same prize. And they shipped me a case of beer, and it was nice. But there's these competitions all the time. I think I've done, because we're quite competitive, right?

It's fun. But again, the competitions only work when there's strict rules. It has to be, for example, if you were doing a competition, and you said you have to run the best flamingo between this day and that day, there's no question that Gustav would do the best flamingo.

Mm -hmm.

No question, but that's not fair to somebody who's just trying to like draw a flamingo on the on the streets, right? So like you have to create different rules for different kinds of events and so you know you have to say like it has to be between 20 and 30 kilometers or no more than 30 kilometers or and or you can't do it on an open field you have to do it on streets or you have to you know there has to be some because there's no way to get a fair competition uh when you have all these I think of I think of these guys as like you know I think of Anthony Hoyt and um and Gustav and I think of them as like they're doing GPS art but they're doing it with different tools you know like the bike is a different tool the stand doing it that Gustav does it is a is a different tool or running it when your fee is a different tool if you're running ultra marathons to do them that's a they're it's like you know like one guy is using you know charcoal and one guy's using acrylic and you know they're just like they're just different mediums I think um so you have to if you're going to do a competition basically that's that was that was that was I was making a joke about the the the competition it's it's kind of it's just kind of stupid right the competition right um there's there's just no way like to do I don't know I don't I was really I did a couple competitions in the beginning and uh I was I you know I was uh really sort of um yeah so uh you know like there was a there was a there was a time where I was like well yeah Gustav his drawings are just better than everybody's it's true they're just better than everybody's but then you you go oh well that's because it's because it's um he took that he took a he took a photo and then he you know then he traced the photo and then um uh so so that's of course he's gonna win of course he's gonna of course his you know his flamingo is gonna be better than my flamingo and of course Lenny's in San Francisco of course his flamingo is gonna be better than my flamingo because his flamingo is 60 miles on a on a grid street in San Francisco yeah um so I think and then also like because because he's doing Lenny's doing it too Lenny does it too I think he does a mix um if you look at his stuff a lot of the things he does are traced he takes an image and and traces them onto the the streets of San Francisco

you

Um, and again, I, I, uh, I think that's unfair in a competition. Um, unless you, unless you classify it, right? Unless you say it has to be less than 30 K or whatever it is. Um, and it has to be an original drawing, but what, what, what, what that is, it's just different than what Jared does and what I do.

And, um, it's just a different, uh, it's just a totally different thing. So anyway, I think, I think early on I was into doing the competitions and then, uh, now I just don't have any interest in doing that unless it's to make like a joke, like we deal with the delirium challenge, which is basically just to make them, uh, realize what a, what a mistake they made by, by, by doing by limiting it to,

uh, people in Belgium. But, uh, anyway, I got a free case of beer out of it and that was, uh, that was fine, but I, if you ever get to London and, uh, want to run an elephant, I've literally got, I don't know, maybe a hundred elephants.

That's cool, maybe I will one day.

Yeah, there's a lot of elephants out there, they're everywhere, they're everywhere.

Maybe I should make an elephant of my own here in Geneva.

Yeah, actually, you know, I've never looked at Geneva, how are the streets in Geneva?

Complicated.

So another thing I do, which I find really fun, is somebody will tell me, like, I'm going to Japan, and I'm training for a marathon, and I want to, you know, can you look at the maps in Tokyo and draw some roots for me out there, and I've looked at, I've drawn things in so many different cities, uh, I've got, like, you know, really good drawings in Seoul and, uh, Tokyo and Amsterdam and loads of them in California,

all across America, and, uh, yeah, people would just say, you know, I'm going to go, I'm going to go, I'm going to go on a holiday here. Can you look at the maps? I'll send them something. And, uh, um, so, maybe I'll look at Geneva.

But do they give you the distance they want to run, or...

Yeah, they usually say, like the lady here who I did the training program for, she said, okay, on this weekend I have to run 20 kilometers, and this weekend I have to run 25, and, um, and, you know, she's like a, she was like a, she was like a superstar runner, where, you know, 30 kilometers was nothing to her, so, um, it was really easy to find a route for her, um, and, uh, and so, you know, a lot of these,

a lot of the guys that I run, you know, because I'm in this morning club, like a lot of these people who go to like, you know, they're going on holiday, they're, they're training for something, and they, uh, they, they need a 30 kilometer route on Sunday, and they, they just need to get it done.

So, um, so I, I'm always looking at different cities. That guy in India, he, um, he asked me to drop, I sent him a bunch of routes, uh, he's done two of them, I think, um, and I think, and then there's a guy in the

Those are the people that you don't know right and you do it for free

Those are the people I don't know. Yeah, I do it for free. I've never really thought about trying to make money out of this. But like I said, when I look at a new city, it's like finding a new puzzle.

It's just like the roads look different. And then it depends on the landscape too, right? It's a different challenge. In London, you've got a very, very big area. But in a smaller city, you have to find you're kind of limited by the shape.

So I travel a lot in France. And I was going on holiday every year in these small French towns where you were limited because you were on a peninsula or something. So you have to think about different animals.

If you're on a peninsula, you have to do penguins because they're standing up. So every time I look at a new city, you see different limitations, right? If you're limited by the sea, you have to, if it's just very narrow, you have to do an alligator or whatever it might be.

But I find that to be a fun challenge.

Well, if you ever make a GPS drawing for Geneva, I would be happy to run it.

Will start I will start I will start looking at Geneva because if you if you would want to run one

but like I'm a bit limited in terms of distance.

What's your max distance?

So far it's been only 10, but since I'm running half marathon in four weeks, well it will be up to 20.

It's been a long time. It's been a long time. It's been a long time. It's been a long time. It's been a long time.

Yeah, so you'll need a long run. Are you going to try to hit a- are you trying- are you trying for a pace?

No, I'm training just to finish.

just to finish yeah then then GPS art would be a good way to do a long run because you don't have to worry about time so much

Yeah.

I don't really talk to people about this, so it's fun for me, but also, I talk to people about this in my running group, but not in, you know, it's a really strange thing because it's never, it's always been a joke to me, but it's also like, it's become something

Mm -hmm.

really good for me like they're cute for me like you know create a creative creative out for me i take it you know i'm joking all the time i take it very seriously i spent a lot of time on those drawings and uh...

and uh... uh... a lot of people that you know the draw something and it kind of looks like an animal uh... and then they go run it and i i don't run anything unless i'm really really happy with it anymore like really like i spent a lot of time uh...

i really i won't even do it unless uh... you know i've considered like every possibility every every turn every variation of the turn sometimes uh... like the one i just finished i think i probably went to like fifty drafts or more but if you ever want me to show you how to do it in google it's it's not you know like when you're in google maps and you do like uh...

you know i'm driving from this point to this point that's not what that's not what i mean by when i say google maps and maybe and maybe if you want me to show you how it works i'd be happy to show you it's uh...

i don't think most people know about this

I sure have no idea how to do it.

Yeah. Yeah, so that was my major breakthrough was figuring this out. If you want me to show you I'm happy to.

It's a...

It made it a lot easier for, I mean we could do it another time, but it made it a lot easier for me to draw faster and more, you know it's like anything else, it becomes like a digital file where you save it and then you save a copy of it and then you edit that and then you can go back to the one you did before, just like any word document you're working on, Google lets you build maps that way and in my Google map,

I mean I probably have thousands and thousands of maps that I've drawn, like some of them just don't go anywhere but just like that's not what I mean by the directions part, that's something, that's Google maps but within Google maps there's a, it's not obvious but there's a way to manipulate that route and you can draw a line, you can draw a line from A to B and Google automatically make that line the quickest way from point A to point B but then what you do is you can drag that,

you can't do that in the directional area but there's another section of Google maps, if you look for it, I don't know why, it's not obvious and I don't think a lot of people know about it but for me, I think that's what, you know we're quite secretive and quite competitive but I suspect Lenny, Lenny Maughan in San Francisco uses that like I do and I suspect that, I suspect that, actually he's the only person I know that I'm pretty certain uses that as well but I think,

I think a lot of people are like, I think, you know, Gustav doesn't use that because he doesn't have to, he can just find an image, trace it and then just drop that image onto a mapping program, I don't know what he uses but he doesn't need to use what I use but I suspect that, I think that's probably, I mean to do a simple drawing now for me in Google maps would take me just days and days if I was using Strava or if I was drawing it on a map

Mm -hmm.

by hand. So anyway, I think that's really the secret for me was Google.

I think I'll have a look myself and try to figure it out, but then if it doesn't work, I'll message you. Yeah, good. But yeah, I can tell that you really enjoy what you're doing and it's been really cool to talk to someone who is so passionate about something.

Yeah, it's strange to be passionate about something like that, but it's become that way.

Yeah, I learnt a lot. Thank you for your insights and thank you for this very cool conversation. Do you mind if I quote you or like mention you in my thesis sometimes or like share some of the information that I'm doing today?

No, I don't, I don't mind at all.

_When reflecting on GPS-drawings being art_

It’s all art. What I have found is that, like with any art, sometimes you like it and sometimes you don’t. I don’t like the art when a cyclist does a drawing that is 200k because I know that’s easy. But other people think it’s amazing because they just see the result. There’s really only two cyclists that I think are artistic. That’s Anthony Hoyte and Christian Ohantel. If you compare any of their drawings, which are mostly all over 200k, to any others who are cycling those distances, you can see they are better. But, if you can draw an elephant under 20k and people can tell it’s an elephant that’s more interesting to me. It’s much harder to do. Ask the cyclists if they can draw anything recognisable in less than 20 k. I don’t think they could. Likewise, one of the most famous Strava artists is a guy in San Francisco. The city is a giant grid and his drawings are almost all more than 80k. On that scale on a grid, you can draw almost anything you want. And often, his drawings are just tracings of other drawings. People like it so that’s art in its own way but I don’t like it.

Some art is more accessible to more people. If a non Strava art aficionado saw what I drew for you and compared it to what Gustavo does or Lenny in SF does there’s no question they would be more impressed by Gustavo\Lenny. But if you know you know.

The drawings we do make people happy and inspire people. And many people try and can’t do it. So, it must be art. But we all like what we like. I still find it hard to consider myself an artist because that’s not what got me into it. But, how I use it to connect with people and make jokes is artistic it it’s own way. I have a WhatsApp group where we’re laughing all the time.

_On what can be considered a GPS-drawing_

I have dozens of drawings that I’m really happy about and think are my best work but I don’t think they are real until they have actually been run/cycled. I don’t know for sure but there is someone in Taiwan who’s is doing drawings all the time that are really good but I’m not 100% sure he is actually running them and I just can’t see him as an artist. It’s a draft until you do it. Or get someone to do it for you.

You running that lion brought me a lot of joy. I was really happy with the drawing itself but it’s just not real until someone runs it. It doesn’t have to be me. Someone else just ran one of my routes in London and it’s the same joy. It’s like the routes just aren’t finished until someone runs them.
