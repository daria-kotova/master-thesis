Started GPS-drawings in 2017

_On how he started doing GPS-drawings_

Kind of by accident. He started jogging and bought a GPS watch. And then he decided it was too boring for him just to make circles or something. And so he decided to try out to make drawings with it. He just turns on his watch and starts jogging, mapping the drawing in his mind.

_On planning_

For 50 years, he's been an artist and drawn every day, by hand. And he has all these drawings in him. And then spontaneously, day by day, he just thinks about something, what he was drawing or experiencing. Lately it was actually Nick Cave's concert. But it's always really spontaneous, and he never knows what's coming out of it. You know, because he doesn't see it before. He recognizes that sometimes, when he has a really strong experience, like the Nick Cave's concert for example, with the strong feelings and so on, that it kind of transports into the drawing. It's intuitively, it's not planned out.

_On his artistic approach_

It's an artistic expression. That's just like a side effect, that it's less boring, the running. But of course, it's about the drawing and about the expression.

So he has this main topic of transformation. Like this analog thing into a digital thing, to transform it and also to send it to a satellite. Like to send it outside and back.

(On some of his works on the website). It's after. It's kind of the transformation back, like this circle, always going back and getting new inspiration through new forms and like transforming it again. He transforms it back into an analog thing and gets a new view, a new perspective to it.

In Palermo, there is a catacomb. It's really unique. It's like mummies hanging on the wall. Creepy, but also really expressive and intense. They have the old clothes on, and relatives used to hang them to remember them. This is also for him a metaphor of transformation. And when he was the first time there he drew them and made a book out of it. And then he painted them, and also he tries it out again in GPS. You have this meta level of transformation again. So for him it's always organic, it's like connected everything, it all goes together.
