- Michael Kutzner (interview together with his daughter Anne, who was translating from German to English)

_Why GPS art? How did you learn about it and why did you decide to do it?_

Kind of by accident. He started jogging and bought a GPS watch. And then he decided it was too boring for him just to make circles or something. And so he decided to try out to make drawings with it. He just turns on his watch and starts jogging, mapping the drawing in his mind.

_So does he plan in advance what he's going to do? Or it's really like on the sport, freestyle._

For 50 years, he's been an artist and drawn every day, by hand. And he has all these drawings in him. And then spontaneously, day by day, he just thinks about something, what he was drawing or experiencing. Lately it was actually Nick Cave's concert. But it's always really spontaneous, and he never knows that what's coming out of it. You know, because he doesn't see it before. He recognizes that sometimes when he like has a really strong experience like the snake cave concept for example with the strong feelings and so on that it kind of transports into the drawing you know that he's like thinking maybe more intensively or something about it and then also sometimes it really shows in the drawing okay you know yeah then the emotions are stronger or something you know but it's yeah it's intuitively it's not planned out you know it's not like that's just sad and then does it and then he has the drawing in the end but he doesn't know before okay and has he tried like the the different type of GPS arts like you probably saw like when people run on the streets because he does it in the park where it's like kind of free canvas but like in the streets you have limitations has he ever tried it as well So,

you have to have another GPS form to work with the entire GPS. That's what you need to do. And then you have to have a limit. So, you have to have a limit. So, you have to have a limit. So, you have to have a limit.

So, you have to have a limit. So, you have to have a limit. So, you have to have a limit. So, you have to have a limit. So, you have to have a limit. So, you have to have a limit. So in the beginning, when he started it, he began with streets, actually, with this limitation, you know?

When you see the early things, that might be not on the website, but then you can see that he had these limitations in the streets, and then more and more, he went more for this and then also we were travelling to different places like Palermo or Norway to try it out on the water with a boat, or different landscapes, in a way, to try it on different landscapes how it works and stuff, you know?

So yeah, he tries to be more and more free with it, actually. Okay, so this is why he chose, he didn't stick to the streets, he decided to make it more. Exactly, he opened it up more. Okay, yeah, that's cool.

And so for him, is it, well, right now, is it a form of artistic self -expression or is it still like a way to make running less boring? No, of course, it's an artistic expression, that's just like a side effect, that it's less boring, the running, but of course, it's about the drawing and, you know, about the expression.

That's the main thing about it, of course, always. So he has, like, now the doc is coming, two topics developed out of it for him. It's like this main topic, like transformation, you know, like this drawing, like this analog thing into like a digital thing, to transport it and also like to send it to like a satellite in a way, you know, like to send it outside and back, you know, it's also like a kind of a frame sort,

you know, that he transports his analog paintings and drawings also in this like digital way, you know, and transforms them, you know, into a landscape, into like a rooms to like interpretate a room's new, you know, like bigger and different.

Okay, you know. And I saw on the website, I didn't really understand, there were like GPS drawings like on the map and then there were like more like normal images with the same drawings but kind of like on a piece of paper so I was like trying to understand is it like after the GPS drawing.

It's after, it's after. Yeah, it's kind of the transformation back, you know, like this circle, you know, always going back and getting new inspiration through new forms and like transforming it again, you know, like to try out.

Yeah, exactly. That's like he transforms it back into an analog thing and gets a new view, you know, to it, a new perspective to it. That's what you just said. This is so called the site inversed because usually people do the other way around and here it's like, wow, it's so unique.

Thank you. Thank you. I mean, it's probably better provocative question, but like so he does like drawings, paintings, culture, I guess, and GPS art. Exactly. Which is like the most favorite out of them.

He cannot, he cannot say, you know, it's everything, it's probably different, I guess. The catacombs, Palermo, and Shechin, they give this orange -tine. The orange -tine worker, and Blythe -Sydig, it's hidden in the book, and Blythe -Sydig, and yet Blythe -Sydig has a band -aid, a GPS transformer, that gives them additional tears.

It's all connected, Nenov, and he describes this example in Palermo. Because my father was a lot in Italy, because he had some art prizes in Italy, so he was a long time there. In Palermo, there is a catacomb.

I don't know if you know it. It's really unique. It's like mummies hanging on the wall. Oh no, really? Yeah, it's really creepy. Creepy, yes. And, of course... but also really expressive and now it's like intense yeah and they have the old clothes on and stuff now and um relatives used to hang them to remember them and stuff is a weird way to remember but yeah and so this is also like for him like a metaphor of transformation yeah and he when he was the first time there he made he draw them and made a book out of it and stuff and uh and then now then he painted them and also he tries it out again in GPS and then you have this meta level of transformation again you know like this so for him it's always like um organic you know it's like connected everything yeah like they cannot part it yeah it all goes together in a way okay naturally yeah okay um did he see other people well like the the works of other people who who do GPS art yes he did uh yeah he looked at it but he finds it a bit boring because it's always like a heart or a bicycle so yeah i wanted to ask does he consider it art so it's too standard for him like that like a rabbit for easter or you know something like this it's true for him to he's not so interested in this so he didn't find someone that's like interesting in GPS art but but like because it's like a philosophical question i guess but does he think that this is also art like not his work but the work of all these other artists who run in cities Thanks to all the students in the U .S.,

I don't know what to judge, he doesn't know what to judge, you know? Well, okay. Because he didn't know that. Okay, well... And he has already had, like, exhibitions, right? I saw some photos, I think, on Instagram, like, where he already...

Where he showed, like, his GPS drawings, right? Yeah, it was actually this year. Sorry, I answered before. And it was this year, like... Where, like... What's it called in English? Like... It's like these prints, you know, like this Andy Warhol prints type.

What? You know, I don't know the English word now. It's like, zitrok, I don't know. It's what Andy Warhol did, you know, like this form of print. Yeah, okay. And also like printed out on huge papers.

That's what it was. The exhibition this year, you know. He printed out some of them and made also prints. Oh, there's this transformation topic again. You know, like printed out with what I have to check.

Sorry. But that was in Berlin, right? No, it was close to Berlin. Okay. You know, it wasn't so... It was like in a... Yeah, yeah. He wants to show you something. It's like this. Wow. It's like, it's from the catacombs actually.

It's a drawing of him. Can I take a screenshot? Obviously a photo mom can. So a screenshot. Yes, yes. Okay. Thanks. And that's called, I have to check the word with... It's screen printing? Screen printing?

No, but I'll have a look. Yeah. Okay. It's like with a photo reaction, you know. You have the original drawing and you can transfer it to print it exactly as it is drawn. If they're drawing, you know, exactly the same kind of...

I guess just one last question. Does he plan to continue and maybe evolve? in a way his GPS art practice. Sorry, again, I said it earlier. Does he plan to continue with doing his GPS art practice and maybe try some new ways of doing it?

I don't know which, but... Okay, but he plans to just not to avoid it and not be able to do GPS art. I don't know if he will be able to do it or not. I don't know if he will be able to do it. Why does GPS not do it?

Is it because of his own information? It's because of his own information. But he will be able to do it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yes, it's okay. But he doesn't want to do it. And he's not concrete or something, you know?

But developing, but... But of course the traveling in other places, other landscapes, you know, to see, to try it out there, you know, how it feels there and stuff, this is maybe the development meant for now, you know, and transforming it more and more and more into other forms of art, you know, in a way, that's but nothing concrete.

Yeah, okay. Okay. As a moment, his mind is assumed, he's a tear machine, it's right, that's the brain, that's the way. Because, yeah, he, now his mission is enough, because he used to, because he's, yeah, he's, he comes back, plus no, he is, he is from Berlin, we are both from Berlin, you know, and he used to draw, to paint machines.

Yeah. You know, a machine? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, and, and, I don't guess the thing, like this, you know? Yeah, uh -huh. And, and he is now, as a topic, he is trying to make a series of it in GPS, kind of, to bring them to space, you know, in a, in a metaphor, for it away, of course, yeah.

That's so cool. Yeah, that's his concrete plan, as a topic, you know, like. But, those are like, do this, do this machine, they mean something, or? The Deutend is a machine, that's what it is. Yeah. Yes, but.

So, these are drugs, they are often mentioned, but I don't know what it is. It's part of the entire thing, it's the entire thing. So, this is the claim, I don't know what it is, but I don't know what it is.

That's right, that's all. Nice. This is a substance, it is a practice, it is a symbolization of the practice, it is a practice of the emotion, and it is also a practice of the emotion. And especially on the tongue.

I don't know what you mean. For him it's like a symbol, like the tar, you know? Also for human living, these machines and, you know, and it's always this transformation in the machines and humanity. thing you know it's like a metaphor like also the tar it's like this form coming from deep you know like from existence like from and like a pressure you know yeah like like black and like you know like the symbolism of this of the color of the of the material of the machines and that's what he what he did today in the morning okay and the machine ah yeah wait how often does he do it like the gps art is it like every day yeah like every day every day and how long are they in the distance um we line up also for energy two or three hours two or three hours yeah and he runs all like all the time and also sometimes just walking you know because when you have details you have to think more yeah and then you have to slow down a bit so it's kind of like uh more than 10k 20k kilometers like in terms of the distance 10 and 20 kilometers every day wow so Yeah,

between 10 and 20 kilometers all together, and then like two or three hours, two hours of course, no? But yeah, but every day, yeah, it's like. I can imagine. It's like, this is Nala machine, this is like a painting, yeah.

And then, yeah, on time, and he does it for seven years now. And he is 69? Yeah, 69, yeah. No, for real, like, I'm trying, I'm trained for a race, I cannot do this, like. That's really good. And because he said it's funny for him, and then when it's fun, then he does it.

Yeah. Because yeah, that's like kind of the power behind it because it's interesting to him and fun, you know. Okay. I think I forgot to ask, like, he started around, like, what time? Because I saw there was a video on the website from 2014.

Yeah. So is it when he started doing GPS art? Yeah, and you mean this video with the shadow, no? Yes. And no, no. This was before, actually. Oh, okay. And he started in 2017 with the GPS, like, to develop, kind of, yeah.

Was he, by any chance, inspired by locative media art? Like, that was popular before, like, iPhone was created and Strahl was created, and there were, like, all these old -school artists with GPS devices walking in the streets.

Was it his inspiration? No. But by any inspiration, this crystal, the forces that smartphones get, it's on the GPS. They also come along and come also now. Maybe they should understand the inspiration.

So I'll go ahead. Okay. Well, you've got this one. Yeah. I've got the smartphone soon yet with the GPS, as well. And, well, if you need a server, then I'll take it. That's what I'm excited about. No, he just found out with the watch, and then he realized, oh, I could draw with it.

Okay. That would be a good idea, you know? Like this, yeah. Yeah. Last question. What is this? sign mean on his website and on Instagram like the logo is it one of his machines it's just this symbol of the wheel you know like he of course comes out of this machine drawings also again and then he extracted it from a drawing as a as a symbol you know because he plans it down fitting kind of okay no yeah okay wow i guess that's it Thank you very much.

I really like his art. It's incredible how he does it and now that I learned that it's like 10 to 20k every day, it's just crazy. And just on the spot without preparation, I'm like, I'm a big fan. As he's a Grosa fan, he is 20 maktos and he was a master.

He says, thank you. Thank you a lot. Well, thank you. Thank you for your time and for this very cool conversation. Thank you a lot. Yeah, thank you too. Good luck, no? He would be happy if he hears from you again how it goes.

Okay. Thank you very much. Bye. Have a nice day. Bye.
