_On GPS-drawings_

I learned to do the GPS artworks because I always worked with map navigation, and map development. I have a certain skill in following routes and I a saw a design from a Canadian biker and that caught my attention. I downloaded his biking track to know how it was done and I saw that it had nothing different. It was as if he was following a route, so I downloaded it on the program and did my first artwork in a sugarcane plantation. When they cut the sugarcane, the area turns out like a soccer field without any obstacles and the designs turn out perfectly. For my surprise, the first person that praised me was that Canadian and I knew I was on the right path.

In the streets it doesn’t turn out good. Here in the city of Natal it doesn’t turn out good because there is a lot of traffic and that’s the main reason and the designs don’t look good in comparison to an open area. If I were to do circle, it wouldn’t turn out perfectly. In an open area like the dunes or a plantation without obstacles, the design turn out better.

There is not a special reason or goal. I have difficulty in running in athletic tracks. So, in an open area and with the designs as an idea, these serve as motivation to culminate the distance that I had in mind.

Once I know which design to do, I can take as many persons I want and let them follow me, so, they have to step foot where I step foot. All of us have to go in single file so that the design turns out the same for all of us

The planning is normally done with a photo and a drawing. Normally with the drawings that children use to draw, a line drawing. With a photo of the line drawing, be it a saying, a phrase, an animal, anything, I put in the map edition program and I lower the opacity so I can see the design and the plot where it will be done, so I can frame the design within that area and with the lapse tool I trace the entire design, adding the maximum of details and that design that I do that's the file tht goes to gps. aAnd once it's there, he hit start on the map

It's a hard question to answer. The other day I did a design for a friend, she wanted to dedicate it to her grandchild and I gave her some suggestions, like peppa pig or Woody Woodpecker. And she said: no I wanted something more personal. Her name, Alicia. So, I said ok, that's fine. Alicia is an easy name to do. She said: but she has autism. I want to add the autism symbol as well. And i did her name and below I added the symbol. But I didn't add the inner puzzle it has. BEcause of the distance that it would require to add these details. And when she saw that, she said: I adore it, I really like it, but there's somtheing missing. And I already knew what it was. That it was the puzzle. Witht the puzzle pattern it would turn out to be 17km, 4 walking hours, more or less. And all of them agreed (to this distance). When the walking ended, each oof them saved the activity on the gps watches. When she saw it done, she started crying. Because when you are walking, you don't know what youre doing. IF someone looks at you from a distance, they think that you're crazy, that you're lost, walking in circles. But it's really fullfilling.

The design itself it's a motivation to those who are going to participate. It works that way. All of those who're going to participate in the walking trail, knowing what the design looks like. They're motivated despite the distance or time. They want to finish that design.

You do need to have a ccertain level of physical condition to execute designs of those. It's no as easy as you may think. But it's another motivation to do physical activity. I think that design does help a lot. But again, you need a physical preparation, it's not that easy.
