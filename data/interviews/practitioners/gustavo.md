_On GPS-drawings_

I learned to do the GPS-artworks, because I always worked with map navigation, and map development. I have a certain skill in following routes and I a saw a design from a Canadian biker, that caught my attention. I downloaded his biking track to know how it was done and I saw that it had nothing different. It was as if he was following a route, so I downloaded it on the program and did my first artwork in a sugarcane plantation. When they cut the sugarcane, the area turns out like a soccer field without any obstacles and the designs turn out perfectly. To my surprise, the first person that praised me was that Canadian and I knew I was on the right path.

_On why free-hand style_

In the streets, it doesn’t turn out good. Here, in the city of Natal, it doesn’t turn out good, because there is a lot of traffic. And that’s the main reason. And the designs don’t look good in comparison to an open area. If I were to do a circle, it wouldn’t turn out perfectly. In an open area, like the dunes or a plantation, without obstacles, the design turns out better.

_On doing it with someone_

Once I know which design to do, I can take as many people as I want and let them follow me. They have to step foot where I step foot. All of us have to go in single file, so that the design turns out the same for all of us.

_On a GPS-drawing dedidacted to someone_

The other day I did a design for a friend. She wanted to dedicate it to her grandchild and I gave her some suggestions, like pPeppa pig or Woody Woodpecker. And she said: no I wanted something more personal. Her name, Alicia. So, I said: ok, that's fine. Alicia is an easy name to do. She said: but she has autism, I want to add the autism symbol as well. And I did her name and below I added the symbol. But I didn't add the inner puzzle it (autism symbol) has, because of the distance that it would require to add these details. And when she saw that, she said: I adore it, I really like it, but there's somtheing missing. And I already knew what it was. That it was the puzzle. Witht the puzzle pattern it would turn out to be 17km, 4 walking hours, more or less. And all of them agreed (to this distance). When the walking ended, each of them saved the activity on the GPS-watches. When she saw it done, she started crying. Because when you are walking, you don't know what you're doing. If someone looks at you from a distance, they think that you're crazy, that you're lost, walking in circles. But it's really fullfilling.

_On motivation_

The design itself is a motivation to those who are going to participate. It works that way. All of those who're going to participate in the walking trail know what the design looks like. They're motivated despite the distance or time. They want to finish that design.

You do need to have a certain level of physical condition to execute these designs. It's not as easy as you may think. But it's another motivation to do physical activity. I think that design does help a lot. But again, you need a physical preparation, it's not that easy.
