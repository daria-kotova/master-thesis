When we moved to Geneva 10 years ago, I found a run group eventually. I kind of run quite a lot on my own and then found that it's actually nicer for me to run with other people. It's good for my mental health. If you know that you're going to meet people it helps to keep going even when things are hard.

It helps with a motivation. There's a thing my wife and I sometimes say. If you're feeling down or you feel like you've got too much on, get outside with your running shoes on, because if you get out the front door with your running shoes on almost always you go for a run. You don't often just go outside close the door and then go back. Very occasionally you might do like one kilometer and be like: I really can't do it, and go home. But you usually get running. So if you can get out with your running shoes on, it's a way

_You founded this club?_

I was a co-foundedr of the Geneva Run Club, which is an informal run group. It doesn't have any legal status in Geneva, it's really informal. And there were, I don't even know, there's about 30 of us who founded it together and then about eight of us agreed to be the admins. So we just wanted a run group that was free, that wasn't formal, that anyone could come along to. We wanted a group that would be like free from racism, free from sexism, free from discrimination. We wanted it to be open to everyone. We wanted it to be that no one or very few people got lost. We wanted to be social. We're not going to make people better runners by training them, you can bring that yourself and whatever. And we started when I think you couldn't, I can't remember if it was like eight people or 30 people or something. which you couldn't have more than. So we always felt slightly like we're playing with the edges of what was allowed. When we first met you couldn't meet inside, you had to meet outside afterwards, so it was kind of like that era.

_Oh, have you started it during COVID?_

Like in the second year of the pandemic in 2021.

Yeah, it feels like you're in a different area.

It's hard to remember that time, right, because it just feels so different. Yeah, we've got things like, in the group we always said there had to be more than one person running it. At the moment I'm kind of like one of the most visible people because I've just been doing it the longest and I feel most comfortable doing it.

and you come over.

I come almost every week.

Twice.

I come like once to twice a week, most weeks. There's a few times when my depression gets more of me and I just don't come, but then there's usually other people to do the other things.

okay and uh coming back to gps art gps arts like how did you learn about it

Well, I can't tell you any more how I learned about it, but...

because we all remember.

There's things that you see and people have done them and I remember thinking for years when I'd seen them that it might be fun to do one. I have gone to the depth of like getting a paper map and starting to draw some ideas around on them but I wouldn't have that anymore so I couldn't show you that as evidence.

But I mean it's fun isn't it when you see other people have done them but I think I probably don't have the patience to do.

Wait, so you did it in London? No. Did you say that you tried it in London? No, no.

Sorry, in Geneva, sorry, not in London, no at all. I can't tell you when I first came across it. It's like, that's unknown. But when I've seen them and they look fun, then I think it would be fun to do it.

And I've, you know, like, because I, Geneva used to have some really great paper maps that used to be available, like in all kinds of places, like of the whole Canton, and then also the streets. So you could, I'm sure, I used to think, you know, I could try something, but it's one thing to think, oh, I could try something.

It's another thing to do it, right? So I couldn't tell you, but for a while I didn't do it, but I did make this one that I can, obviously, I made the Paris one. In Geneva. So that was in Geneva in 2020.

So I started a new job. And one of the things that was interesting when I started the job was we were gonna organize a conference in Paris for like a hundred people. And it's to do with a faith group that I'm in.

And so I was really looking forward to it. And then by the time I started the job, the pandemic was starting. Right. And then they put the conference online. So to the first day of the conference, I went out and I worked out how in the park, like in the park Lagrange and Park des Ovi in Geneva, I could spell out the words Paris.

Sorry, the words, the letters Paris. And I think it was quite, quite basic. I used the bottom of the park as my bottom, but it meant that when I just posted it, it was upside down. But you know, you can change the GPS, sure.

But for the purposes, and what I used it for, because then I took a screenshot of it and I was able to post it like in the social groups for the people at the conference. So then a lot of people appreciated that I made this effort because to them that was the first time they was, because then a lot of them won't be runners or in Strava or anything like this.

So to them, a lot of them, that was something unusual. So it made the gesture, right? That it was a big gesture to them to say, thinking of all of them, that we're not meeting in person.

Do it more as a gesture or just the phone?

It wasn't just, it was like I did it in my, it was very specifically for, with these people in mind, to send them a message. And also because I knew it would be fun to do something like this, like I meant to do it for a while, and now I actually did one for the first time.

What did you think after you did it? Did you like it?

I kind of had this feeling while I was doing it that like worrying about whether it was going to show up the right way and like when the netters going to like clash with each other but it was nice I'm glad I did it and it was fun to do it in a sort of way but not fun enough that I made anymore you know like so it's fun like you know like there's a again another story a thing that my wife and I often say about doing something particularly when we go swimming in the uh you never regret a swim but the main thing is you do something for the anecdote so sometimes if you're not sure about doing something do it so you've got a story to tell afterwards

Yeah.

right? So that's why I do it for the anecdote. So like doing something like that was oh yeah I did that.

Okay Yeah, it is actually Because you kind of did it for a cause yeah, that's one of my subtopics as well. Okay fair enough I thought are you you just did it on the bottom because it was no no it was

actually there was a purpose. I couldn't tell you now where I don't think I would know where to look for it because it's an old job and you know they're groups so there's nowhere I could see that was still posted somewhere online.

We're your founders

I found it in Strava because at first I did a search for Paris and then I couldn't find it so then I knew when the conference was roughly so I did a search for April and May 2020 and then I just looked through it until I found it.

And how did you plan it?

on the planet.

like a word what tools you think I look I think I must

looked at a map of yeah like a Google Maps or something of all one of my paper maps maps of the park and then just worked out how I could do the letters and like with the baseline trying to make sure that it didn't look too much like like what the letters merge with the liner you know what I mean so it didn't look

But you said that you're curious to maybe try it again, right?

Well, yeah, I'll do it for the adding tape.

Okay, yeah

Yeah, why not? I mean, when the woman shared the one of the dog, I did think last week that I have already worked out in the park that we run through as Geneva Run Club how to do GRC.

Yeah.

so

And you look near biased, so it should be...

So it shouldn't be that difficult to do and then don't know it's thinking about Like If you if you worked out something like I love you like I and then heart and you You can set that up and then you can like do something like tell people Like it like have it in the run group and like just before like Valentine's Day You can get people invite people then they can do it for themselves to Share with their loved ones or there's someone right and you could find or find some I don't know What would you do to make?

I was trying to think what if you were going to do something that was fun like But you might encourage other people to do what would it be like because doing GRC is one thing We could like it's ready I was thinking like you could do some share with people how to do it like signpost it But you probably if you want to make something more interesting.

I What shapes you would do or what? Like would you do that? What what would be distinctive about Geneva that you would run like would you run the jadeau? Or would you read some words or something? I don't know

Have you considered that maybe you can organize a collaboration event within the club? With several people, I don't know how many people draw together something. Because I don't know, I don't remember the name.

I talked to someone, someone messaged me from the club. And she told me that they did this during the pandemic, I think. Someone from Lazy Boys, and each person drew a letter. And then all together they got the worst at Lazy Boys.

I can probably put you in touch. I will check with Siobhan, who is one of the people who told you about it.

But he has already told me about it. She's told you about it already? I promise that I'm not going to bother him anymore.

You're not going to follow it up?

I promise that I'm not gonna bother him more because he has already sent me like messages with explanation

Was it Siobhan or was it Sonja? I think it was. She?

That's a guy, right? That's a girl, right? Wait, I need to pause my... Really? I was sure it was a guy. Anyway, what else? So yeah, if you ever consider doing like a collaboration thing, projects within the club...

What's the deadline we need to do it by to help you?

Well, I mean, I need to submit my thesis by the beginning of December.

Yeah, but you don't want to be like having new stuff in December. Yeah, yeah, obviously, obviously. So like sometime... Probably the next few weeks, really.

But, I mean, that would be a fun idea, but if you don't hear it, it's fine. What was it?

You can't be more aggressively positive. Yeah, you should do this thing.

I don't know, it's really kind of difficult contacting people.

for groups and stuff, or if you ask for other people.

You know, they're certainly hungry.

in Geneva, you could find it all.

Really, I want to know Lazy Boys and, um, G .I.

There's another group in Facebook, you can find the GVA runners, the guy whose name... Yeah, sorry, yeah.

Like, if you talk about people who are kind of like beginners, beginners who are like starting running, do you think doing GPS drawing may help them in terms of motivation?

Uh, oh my god.

Is there a tricky question?

No, it's just that I've got no idea, if I was starting running, it's a bit like that thing like, maybe, I wonder if you have like ones that are set up already, like whether it would be fun to someone knowing like they didn't have to, like with our run group, people like to turn up and follow a route that already exists, then they don't have to, like when they go running on their own, you kind of invent your own run,

right? There's a bit of brain power in doing that, mental load. So it's a bit like if you, some people like colouring books or like dot to dot, so if you have something you could follow, I reckon that might be interesting to people.

Okay.

but I think it depends on the person type because some people that might be fun to go and explore. So you might you know there's different yeah you know like this people like people learn in different ways some people are visual some people listen to it some people need to explain it to others I wonder if there's different styles of getting into running but

Yeah, I guess you're right.

Now I don't guess I'm right, I'm probably wrong.

No, no, but you are right and that people are different.

I'm in.

And again, I have a friend who ran for me yesterday, she made some weird bird, and she said the same thing that you just said, that there was a base of images, and you didn't have to think and plan what exactly you're going to run, she would probably be more encouraged to do it.

I think it depends on the quality of it.

But if you know the tech, if you've got the technical know -how, play it. Play it.

I'm sorry, were you guys stuck in the art thing? Oh, I'm sorry, it's no different. Yeah, we are like, we are about to finish anyone. We just started with the last question. Yeah, no, but you can stay for one.

It's not like confidential or anything.

I'm going to mention you in my thesis if it's ok for you.

No worries, use whatever content you want. And somebody asked in the group recently, did someone have the GPS download of Lausanne Marathon or something? If you could make the GPS download so that people would just follow a route, then that would be the easiest way to do it.

But I don't actually know how to myself to take the GPS download and then put it into my phone or my watch so I follow it. I'm not that technically competent. But that might be the sort of thing that people could do, not to influence your.
