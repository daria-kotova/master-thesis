# Jez (founded Geneva Run Club in 2021)

_On running and founding a run club_

When we moved to Geneva 10 years ago, I found a run group eventually. I kind of run quite a lot on my own and then found that it's actually nicer for me to run with other people. It's good for my mental health. If you know that you're going to meet people it helps to keep going even when things are hard.

It helps with a motivation. There's a thing my wife and I sometimes say. If you're feeling down or you feel like you've got too much on, get outside with your running shoes on, because if you get out the front door with your running shoes on almost always you go for a run. You don't often just go outside close the door and then go back. Very occasionally you might do like one kilometer and be like: I really can't do it, and go home. But you usually get running. So if you can get out with your running shoes on, it's a way

I was a co-foundedr of the Geneva Run Club, which is an informal run group. It doesn't have any legal status in Geneva, it's really informal. And there were, I don't even know, there's about 30 of us who founded it together and then about eight of us agreed to be the admins. So we just wanted a run group that was free, that wasn't formal, that anyone could come along to. We wanted a group that would be like free from racism, free from sexism, free from discrimination. We wanted it to be open to everyone. We wanted it to be that no one or very few people got lost. We wanted to be social. We're not going to make people better runners by training them, you can bring that yourself and whatever. And we started when, I can't remember if it was like eight people or 30 people or something, which you couldn't have more than. So we always felt slightly like we're playing with the edges of what was allowed. When we first met you couldn't meet inside, you had to meet outside afterwards, so it was kind of like that era.

_On how he learnt about GPS-drawings_

Well, I can't tell you any more how I learned about it. There're things that you see and people have done them. And I remember thinking for years when I'd seen them that it might be fun to do one. I have gone to the depth of getting a paper map and starting to draw some ideas around on them, but I wouldn't have that anymore, so I couldn't show you that as evidence. But I mean it's fun, isn't? But I think I probably don't have the patience to do.

_On his Paris GPS-drawing_

So that was in Geneva in 2020. I started a new job. And one of the things that was interesting when I started the job was we were gonna organize a conference in Paris for like a hundred people. And so I was really looking forward to it. And then by the time I started the job, the pandemic was starting. And then they put the conference online. So to the first day of the conference, I went out and I worked out how in the park La Grange I could spell out the letters "Paris". And I think it was quite basic. I used the bottom of the park as my bottom, but it meant that when I just posted it, it was upside down.

What I used it for. Then I took a screenshot of it and I was able to post it in the social groups for the people at the conference. A lot of people appreciated that I made this effort, because to them that was something unusual. So it made the gesture. It was a big gesture to them to say: thinking of all of them, that we're not meeting in person. It was very specifically with these people in mind, to send them a message. And also because I knew it would be fun to do something like this, like I meant to do it for a while, and now I actually did one for the first time.

_On whether he liked it_

It was nice, I'm glad I did it. And it was fun to do it, but not fun enough that I made anymore. There's a again another thing that my wife and I often say,is you do something for the anecdote. So sometimes if you're not sure about doing something, do it so you've got a story to tell afterwards.
