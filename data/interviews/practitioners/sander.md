_On differetn GPS-drawings styles_

There is this thing called freehand drawing, which is just an open field or open desert, where you are not limited by streets. You have road style or street style - the style I'm doing most. And you have connecting the dots, where you pause your GPS watch, walk to the other side of the town and press play again and then it draws a line between those two dots. But it allows you to be very creative and create some very interesting figures that are not really possible to run because you're just drawing a straight line over buildings and over rivers and everything. So some might consider that cheating. I only consider it cheating if you're not open about it, and if you're doing it as part of your road style run, and then doing it to connect pieces. But yeah, so there's a lot of different options out there, depending on where you are at.

For road style, you really need a big city to have enough space to create some detail in it. You have some cities like New York, or San Francisco, or Barcelona, where there's a grid with all squares, which has the advantage that you can create almost anything there, but it's a bit retro game looking with pixely.

And the advantage that I have here in Amsterdam is that the streets are quite wavy, so it can create natural forms. But that doesn't allow me to create anything, so I'm really dependent on the streets, if the image I have in my mind can be created or not.

_On how he learnt about GPS-drawings and on his practice_

I think there was an article in an outdoor magazine called Salt in 2019. I heard about figure running before, but that was really when I saw the article. It was about a Canadian guy, I believe, who called himself Cycalangelo and he did GPS art on the bike. Looking at the figure he tried to make, I was like: yeah, I see what you're trying to do, but I'm going to give this a try as well. From his name, Cycalangelo, I made up my name, Rembrandt, because it's running.

Rembrandt is a Dutch master painter, so that was a nice coincidence that was possible. I think I did maybe three GPS art routes in 2019, and then I left it alone for a bit, because it takes quite a lot of time to prepare a route, especially when you try to do it in the level of detail that I'm trying to do, because I only run it if it's close to anatomically correct. So I left it alone for about a year.

Then COVID hit and the races were cancelled. I was supposed to go to the Dolomiti Extreme Trail in Italy, but that was cancelled, and then I was frustrated because I was really looking forward to do this. Then I picked up the GPS art again.

_On becoming known by the community and media_

And then I ran a rooster in Harlem, close to Amsterdam, and that was picked up by the local media. They reached out to me and asked if it's okay to ask me some questions, because they want to make an article for their website. So I was like: yeah, sure, that sounds fun. Then they texted me and said that the national news wants to use the article for their website as well, so I was quite excited. Then, in a couple of days, it was really crazy, because the article from the national news said that Runbrandt is going viral with GPS art. I wasn't going viral until they said I was going viral. The next morning, I was in all the major radio shows. In the morning show, they sent me messages through Instagram, through Facebook Messenger. I was in like six or seven radio shows the day after.

The day after, I ran a route in Hilversum, and that's where all the television studios are. In the mid -run, I received a call and I picked it up. It was like the kids news, the national kids news. They wanted to do an item about Runbrandt. That was quite fun, because I was close by. I said, if you can meet me at the parking lot in about an hour, then I'm done with my run. Then we can do the item. That same evening, it was on the kids news, and then my Instagram exploded with messages from kids. At a certain point, I just handed my phone to my wife and said, can you please do some of these messages, because I can't take any more messages.

That same evening, I was on a podcast for a local runners community that was already planned like months before, but coincidentally, that was that same evening. In a matter of 24 hours, it was completely crazy.

I wouldn't say I'm famous, but most runners in these Amsterdam and surrounding areas know me.

_On planning his drawings_

So there are two scenarios. One is I get a request or an idea and I try to find a place on the map where it fits. Or there's a place I want to create something and I stare long enough at the map until I see like one little detail and that can be like an eye or a beak of a bird or a paw of an animal.And then I plot the rest of the route roughly. And then I drag my lines and recreate parts of the route until it's anatomically correct. And if that works out then I'll run it.

_On supporting causes and raising funds_

Organizations, events, charities. I did a couple of runs to raise money for a couple charities. One was for Plastic Soup Foundation, the killer whale on my profile. I ran to raise money for Plastic Soup Foundation. It's a foundation that focuses on reducing the use of plastic and it takes plastic out of the ocean. And I did one for cancer research in pets and one for like a holiday home for families with terminally ill kids. And they used to do physical runs to raise money, but during COVID they couldn't do the physical run. So I created a virtual run where people could run from anywhere and create the logo of the organization in a virtual way.

For the Plastic Soup Foundation, it wasn't massive, I raised like a thousand euros and I raised some awareness. So it was fun and it contributes. But it's not like the holy grail of raising funds. I think it's just another fun way to do it.

I just ran that route and collected donations for running the killer whale. But there are other options as well. You can also ask people to pay for it or do a donation to join for a run. Earlier today, I was talking to a guy for a fundraiser that's going to happen in May next year, and that's actually what I'm going to propose him for that run. That people can join that GPS run in return for a donation of choice. And for the rest, it's just awareness and a fun way to contribute a little bit.

_On running with a group_

I do some guided GPS art routes ,where I just get a group of people and say: I'm going to run a GPS art starting from there, who wants to join? And it's a surprise what the end result will be. That's always very fun, because during the run they start to speculate what it will be and they're always way off.

I did one presentation at the running shop here close by and it was together with Oakley, the sunglasses brand. And because it was also with Oakley they thought it might have been sunglasses, but it turned out to be an eagle, a bird.

_On the meaning of GPS-drawings to him_

It's a fun way to look at running. So what I'm trying to achieve with sharing my art is to show that there's another way to look at running than just being the fastest, right? So, in my opinion, running is tthe closest sport for humans, we're basically made to run. But by focusing too much on speed, many people who don't have the perfect body shape for what they consider runners, they think: well, it's not for me. And what I'm trying to do with my art is focus more on the creative part. It doesn't have to be fast, it doesn't have to be far, but create something fun. And that's the thing I'm trying to achieve with this on the side.

And what it does for me is that on a long run, I don't want to look at my watch and say, oh, I have so many kilometers to go. If I'm running a GPS art, the only thing that matters is the next corner. From that moment onwards, only the next corner is relevant. So I'm not busy with time, with distance, not with pace or speed. The only thing I'm worried about is, let's take the next turn and make it look right.

And because you're creating something and a figure, there's no doubt in my mind that I'm going to finish the route. Because otherwise, it's a failed attempt and I have to do the whole thing again. So it really motivates me and it helps me to do very long runs without struggling with the distance, the time or beating myself up over speed.

_On sharing his routes with others_

It's always fun, because some of my routes are openly available on my website. Others, I just shared the link to the download with people. And it's always making me smile when I open my Instagram and I see that someone has run my route, enjoyed it and shared it with the world again. I've got a couple of die hard followers, I think maybe between 5 or 10. Every time I create something new, within a week or two they will run it as well.

_On meeting people through GPS-drawings_

It's a fun way to meet runners and people that you otherwise wouldn't meet. Because usually I reach out to people who run ultras and would normally not be in my range of contacts to just say: hey, let's go for a run together. But now with the GPS art, it's such a fun thing, that most say: oh, that sounds cool, let's go for it. So it resulted in many super interesting connections that I wouldn't have without the GPS art.
