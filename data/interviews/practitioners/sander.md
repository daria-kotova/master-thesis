There is this thing called freehand drawing, which is just an open field or open desert, where you are not limited by streets. You have road style or street style - the style I'm doing most. And you have connecting the dots, where you pause your GPS watch, walk to the other side of the town and press play again and then it draws a line between those two dots. But it allows you to be very creative and create some very interesting figures that are not really possible to run because you're just drawing a straight line over buildings and over rivers and everything. So some might consider that cheating. I only consider cheating if you're not open about it, and if you're doing it as part of your road style run, and then doing it to connect pieces. But yeah, so there's a lot of different options out there, depending on where you get.

For road style, you really need a big city to have enough space to create some detail in it. You have some cities like New York, or San Francisco, or Barcelona, where there's a grid with all squares, which has the advantage that you can create almost anything there, but it's a bit retro game looking with pixely, right?

And the advantage that I have here in Amsterdam is that the streets are quite wavy, so it can create natural forms. But that doesn't allow me to create anything, so I'm really dependent on the streets if the image I have in my mind can be created or not.

Yeah, I also saw on Wikipedia, there was some style, I don't remember the name, it's something with a bee, but it's like when people try to run like all the street houses.

Thanks for watching!

Yeah, but I don't think it's actually like can be categorized as art like GPS art

a town and that became really popular during the COVID lockdowns and people not being allowed to run far away from their homes or to like running events. So then Birmingham started to get a bit more popular also here in the Netherlands.

But yeah, I don't really consider it art.

yeah well before you like start talking about your practice can you like tell me how you started running what made you do it and how long have you been running

running and just the normal running

Yeah, and then we'll talk about GPS art running.

I started running in 2011, 2012. I was living in New Zealand back in those days and there was a colleague of mine who was trading for the New York Marathon. It was the year that it was cancelled and she was so enthusiastic about it and she said well there's a there's a marathon here in Auckland as well that's where we lived and then I looked on the website and three weeks later already was the the marathon so I felt comfortable enough with my standard fitness to do the 10k.

So I just signed up for the 10k and I spent three weeks my lunch breaks on the Monday, Wednesday or Friday to train for it and then I ran the 10k and I really liked it shortly after we moved back to the Netherlands and then I struggled with a bit of motivation and I was basically running the same loop around the house once twice a week and I tried to do it every time a bit faster than the time before and I quickly found out that that wasn't the way to improve your running so I looked online for like a running club or running crew and I joined the Amsterdam running junkies which is just an urban running crew that comes together for social runs every week and so I remember that I joined them in a rainy September evening and the first question I got was are you training for a half marathon or a full marathon and I was like I'd rather do like a five or 10k and do it fast and run a half marathon or a full marathon and that was on in September and in January I ran my first half marathon because it went so fast because after a couple of weeks I found out that next to the Tuesday evening social run they did an interval session on the track near the Olympic stadium so I joined that one

Thank you.

and shortly after I discovered they were also doing like a long distance run on the Sunday morning and I joined that one so all of a sudden I was running three times a week with this group of very enthusiastic people and that just made that I improved quite fast.

So that January I ran my first half then I signed up for a full one but I got injured.

Mmm.

and then I skipped the full distance and I went training for ultra marathons so 50k in my case and yeah I followed the program called Star2Ultra in which they guide you from a 20 kilometer distance up to 50 kilometers and yeah been running longer distances ever since still haven't done the full marathon officially I did a GPS art full marathon but just just by myself and I'm actually working on a fun project for this December where we're gonna do a small event that's called the biggest Christmas card where we will run a GPS art in Christmas team and the people that run and join us can use it as a

Would you consider yourself like a professional runner then? No, no, no. Not at all. Well, I mean, you run ultra marathons, I mean. Yeah, just for fun.

It's not fast enough, the goal is just to have a lot of fun and to finish and to be able to walk again in a couple of days after I finish. So no, definitely not a professional runner, nowhere close.

Okay, professional amateur runner. How did you first learn about GPS art and when?

I think there was an article in an outdoor magazine called Salt in 2019. I heard about figure running before, but that was really when I saw the article. It was about a Canadian guy, I believe, who called himself Cycalangelo and he did GPS art on the bike.

Looking at the figure he tried to make, I was like, yeah, I see what you're trying to do, but I'm going to give this a try as well. From his name, Cycalangelo, I made up my name, Rembrandt, because it's running.

Rembrandt is a Dutch master painter, so that was a nice coincidence that was possible. I think I did maybe three GPS art routes in 2019, and then I left it alone for a bit, because it takes quite a lot of time to prepare a route, especially when you try to do it in the level of detail that I'm trying to do, because I only run it if it's close to anatomically correct.

So I left it alone for about a year, then COVID hit and the races were cancelled. I was supposed to go to the Dolomiti Extreme Trail in Italy, but that was cancelled, and then I was frustrated because I was really looking forward to do this.

Then I picked up the GPS art again, and then I ran a rooster in Ireland, close to Amsterdam, and that was picked up by the local media. They reached out to me and asked if it's okay to ask me some questions, because they want to make an article for their website.

So I was like, yeah, sure, that sounds fun. Then they texted me and said that the national news wants to use the article for their website as well, so I was quite excited. I was like, that's super cool.

Of course there are a lot. Then, in a couple of days, it was really crazy, because they said that the article from the national news said that room ground is going viral with GPS art. I wasn't going viral until they said I was going viral.

The next morning, I was in all the major radio shows. In the morning show, they sent me messages through Instagram, through Facebook Messenger. I was in like six or seven radio shows the day after. The day after, I ran a route in Hilversum, and that's where all the television studios are.

In the mid -run, I received a poll and I picked it up. It was like the kids news, the national kids news. They wanted to do an item about room ground. That was quite fun, because I was close by. I said, if you can meet me at the parking lot in about an hour, then I'm done with my run.

Then we can do the item. That same evening, it was on the kids news, and then my Instagram exploded with messages from kids. At a certain point, I just handed my phone to my wife and said, can you please do some of these messages, because I can't take any more messages.

That same evening, I was on a podcast for a local runners community that was already planned like months before, but coincidentally, that was that same evening. In a matter of 24 hours, it was completely crazy.

So you're famous.

I wouldn't say I'm famous, but most runners in these Amsterdam and surrounding areas know me.

okay so and that was uh like during covid or after covid yeah it was 2020 but you started doing gps art before covid yeah okay because quite a lot of people kind of said you and called it out of boredom um well can you tell me how you plan your runs

Yeah, so there are two scenarios. One is I get a request or an idea and I try to find a place on the map where it fits. Or there's a place I want to create something and I stare long enough at the map until I still see like one little detail and that can be like an eye or the beak of a bird or the paw of an animal.

And then I plot the rest of the route roughly and then I drag my lines and recreate parts of the route until it's close to and automatically correct and if that works out then I'll run it.

And what's up to these?

plotaroutes .com

Okay, because I've been trying to do it in Strava and it's like very tricky

Yes, Tramper doesn't allow you to want to root this error, to redo certain parts, so that's not very useful, frankly.

Yeah.

Back in the days that I started, Strava, the root creator was still in the free Strava package, but now it's only at the premium Strava.

Yeah, to you said that sometimes you get a request to like plan a route, it was like from your friends or from some organizations, events or I don't know.

Organizations, events, charities. I did a couple of runs to raise money for a couple charities. One was for Plastic Soup Foundation, the killer wheel on my profile. I ran to raise money for Plastic Soup Foundation.

What is this foundation?

Yeah, it's a foundation that's focused on reducing the use of plastic and it takes plastic out of the ocean.

Mm -hmm.

And I did one for cancer research in pets and one for like a holiday home for families with terminally ill kids. And they used to do physical runs to raise money, but during COVID they couldn't do the physical run.

So I created a virtual run where people could run from anywhere and create the logo of the organization in a virtual way.

And do you organize some of this like running events yourself?

Not really running events yet. The one in December coming up is the first one that I will organize from myself, but I partner up with a local running coach who has a massive following and a lot of people who can run a marathon distance just for fun to create some GPS art.

I did do some guided GPS art routes where I just got a group of people and said I'm going to run a GPS art starting from there, who wants to join, and it's a surprise what the end result will be. That's always very fun because during the run they start to speculate what it will be and that they're always way off.

I did one presentation at the running shop here close by and it was together with Oakley, the sunglasses brand, and because it was also with Oakley they thought it might have been sunglasses, but it turned out to be an eagle, a bird.

Wait, I saw in your highlights, is it the one? I thought it was a parrot, but...

Yeah, so that's the fun thing, so about half the people say no, it's definitely a parrot at the other houses. No, no, no, it's an e -book. I'm fine with both.

Yeah, I also saw in your highlights, but I didn't understand it was it because it was in Dutch Something like acti kanker or I don't know how to read it. Yeah, what is that?

was to raise money for the cancer research in animals.

Okay.

Okay. Well, what is travel art for you? What does it give you?

It's a fun way to look at running, so what I'm trying to achieve with sharing my art is to show that there's another way to look at running than just being the fastest, right? So, in my opinion, running is the most, the closest sport for humans, we're basically made to run.

If you look at the boss and how we used to hunt, so it's a very natural sport to us. But by focusing too much on speed, many people who don't have the perfect body shape for what they consider runners leave it, they think, well, it's not for me.

And what I'm trying to do with my art and focus more on the creative part, it doesn't have to be fast, it doesn't have to be far, but create something fun. And that's the thing I'm trying to achieve with this on the side.

And what it does for me is that on a long run, I don't want to look at my watch and say, oh, I have so many kilometers to go. If I'm running a GPS art, the only thing that matters is the next corner.

So and from that moment onwards, only the next corner is relevant. So I'm not busy with time, with distance, not with pace or speed. The only thing I'm worried about is, let's take the next turn and make it look right.

And because you're creating something and a figure, there's no doubt in my mind that I'm going to finish the route, right? Because otherwise, it's a failed attempt and I have to do the whole thing again.

Yeah.

So compared to doing a full marathon on your own and not having the goal of creating an art, then you may think halfway, I've already done a half marathon, why should I do another one? Or just let's take the shortest route home because I'm not feeling it today.

That's not an option. So it really motivates me and it helps me to do very long runs without struggling with the distance, the time or beating myself up over speed.

Yeah, I completely agree with you. I have found this effect myself and sometimes like a couple of days I ran in the rain and I normally I would never do it but because I have this had this goal of drawing a face like I forced myself to go and so I completed my run and it's very helpful.

So would you say that like it can be a sort of motivation for someone who is just trying who is just starting running or Yahoo is just struggling with motivation.

Yeah, it can be. And it doesn't have to be, you don't have to run them, right? You can also do a hike and so I think I make moving fun for people who don't usually see the fun in doing a hike or doing a run, or like running, but only the short distances, then I'll try to motivate them to do a longer run.

Just not focus on speed or at all.

and have already people reached out saying hey I saw this one this like GPS route that you made and I did it and

Yeah, it's always fun because some of my roots are openly available on my website. Others, I just shared the link to the download with people and it's always making me smile when I open my Instagram and I see that someone has run my roots and enjoyed it and shared it with the world again.

So that's a lot of fun. I've got a couple of die hard followers, I think maybe between 5 or 10, that every time I create something new, within a week or two they will do the, they will run it as well.

So that's a lot of fun.

lot of fun as well and you yourself have you tried like GPS art made by someone else like Davos

Whenever I'm in Natal, Brazil, I will definitely reach out to Gustavo and see if he's available to run something with him. One time I went to London and I reached out to Jarek, a code runner guy on Instagram.

Thank you.

to see if he was a man.

Yeah

Yeah, because I created a nice route that I was key to run together with him if he would be available, but he wasn't available, unfortunately, but other than that I've never run a route from someone else, but I'm always keen to take other runners on one of my creations.

And do you prefer more rain alone or this roots over someone?

I think with someone it's always more fun, depending on, now, usually I like it more to do it with someone, especially to see their reaction afterwards, because usually I don't tell them what I'm going to run, only if they really want to know and they really insist on seeing the picture first before they commit to it, then I'll show it, but otherwise I won't, and it's a fun way to meet runners and people that you otherwise wouldn't meet,

because usually I reach out to people who are running ultras and would normally not be in my range of contacts to just say, hey, let's go for a run together, but now with the GPS art, it's such a fun thing that most say, oh, that sounds cool, let's go for it, so it resulted in many super interesting connections that I wouldn't have without the GPS art.

I think actually you have given me an idea, like I think I'm gonna try with one of my friends and also plan a route and run with them, but without telling them what the route is actually and see their reaction.

I believe it's super nice. I guess just one last question, so you've done some of the rounds as like fundraising things, do you think it helps?

Yes, for the Plastic Soup Foundation it wasn't massive, I raised like a thousand euros and I raised some awareness, so it was fun and it contributes, but it's not like the holy grail of raising funds, I think it's just another fun way to do it.

So is it like participants paid for participation or how did it work?

I just ran that route and collected donations for running the killer wheel, but there are other options as well, right? You can also ask people to pay for it or do a donation to join for a run. I'm actually talking earlier today, I was talking to a guy for a fundraiser that's going to happen in May next year, and that's actually what I'm going to propose him for that run that people can join.

The guy that GPS hard run in return for a donation of choice, and for the rest it's just awareness and a fun way to contribute a little bit. I'm not here to make money out of it or I'm not thinking that it will be hugely impactful but just a fun way to contribute.

Mm -hmm.

okay well I think I don't have any more questions but thank you very much it was very fun and interesting to talk to you I learned a lot of new useful things do you mind if
