# My journal

This is a journal where I recorded my own experience of creating GPS-drawings over the course of 6 weeks. All routes, except one, are planned by me and correspond with the distances I had to cover according to my half-marathon training plan. One route was run together with Andrés.

## Day 1. 17.09.2024 (heart, 6k)

![heart](/data/images/self-experiments/my_journal/heart.png)

It took me around 15 minutes to figure out how to plan my first route and make a distinguishable image that would correspond with the distance I aimed to achieve based on my training plan. Even though I chose quite a simple shape of a heart, it was somewhat tricky to make it look recognisable, since the streets and their intersections tend to be edgy and not curvy enough. I would rate the final result as 7 out of 10 on the level of resemblance.

This was my first run after weeks of not working out at all, so I was surprised to have completed it. Running an already predetermined route, as opposed to running blindly trying to achieve a certain distance, frees you from considering what direction to follow next. The fact that I was focused more on completing the drawing, neglecting the geographical aspect of where I was doing it, let me explore new parts of the city that I normally would not go to. I got to see fields with cows not far from Mont Salève and two donkeys casually eating grass by the road.

I think when you run a race you have a well-determined goal, which is to complete the race in a certain time or simply complete it. However, when you do preparatory runs the goal is diluted, since it is so far away in time, which may affect your motivation. Thus, adding another layer of motivation in the form of completing your drawing and afterwards sharing it with the world may be helpful. So, even though I slowed down and switched to walking at some segments, I still went on and completed the route.

## Day 2. 18.09.2024 (hi, 2k)

This time it took me a bit less to get the shape I wanted, but my main limitation was the distance, 3 km (2 km in the end). The shorter the distance, the more difficult it is to get something clear. I actually had to run over the same segments of route to achieve the image-distance balance. Unfortunately, I was still tired from the previous day and so cut it short, which made me think that without my drawing in mind I would have completely abandoned.

## Day 3. 21.09.2024 (fish, 6k)

![fish](/data/images/self-experiments/my_journal/fish.png)

This time I had to adapt my approach. Originally I wanted to draw a silhouette of a cat, but I couldn’t find any spot on the map that would match it. So I ended up looking instead at the map and trying to find some interesting shapes. This is how I got my fish.

This run was in a way tricky, because it took me around 40 minutes to get to the starting point and by that time I had only 10% of battery on my phone. I was pressured to finish quickly, so my fatigue was not my main concern. Surprisingly, I did not switch to walking. By some miracle, I completed the drawing the second my phone died.

On my way to the starting point, while I was waiting for one tram, that never came, and then for another, I was actually considering giving up and postponing the run till another day. It was already late in the evening and dark (safety concerns). But I’m satisfied with how this run has turned out both in terms of of the drawing and my overall performance.

## Day 4. 23.09.2024 (just running)

Today I went back to running with Geneva Run Club after nearly a year-long pause. What can I say... The fact that you run with someone definitely pushes you to go on. At some point, I was really tempted to switch to walking which is often the case when I get tired and I'm alone. But with other people running with you, either you drop out and are left behind or you go on through pain. I think I prefer to have the option of walking when I need to and get motivation from creating something rather than from not wanting to be left alone.

## Day 5. 26.09.2024 (face, 7k)

![face](/data/images/self-experiments/my_journal/face.png)

This was my least favorite run. I was proud with the result but the fact that it took place in a pouring rain made it really unsatisfying. No way would I have done it in these conditions if it hadn’t been for the drawing I had in mind. This is the GPS-art motivation at its best. I probably walked a third of the road, but yet somehow forced myself to run the rest of the distance I had left from my training plan even though the drawing was already complete.

I understand more and more that with this drawings it is very rare that you can just have an idea in mind and draw it on the map. Most of the time you find inspiration from the map itself. This is how I found my drawing of a man, let’s call him Fred. Fred has very pronounced nose and mouth features thanks to the road that served as the starting point for my inspiration and led to the final idea.

## Day 6. 29.09.2024 (bird, with Andrés, 5k)

![bir](/data/images/self-experiments/my_journal/bird.png)

Today I ran with my friend the route I had prepared for us. He had no clue what it would be and had to blindly follow me. The run took place in Ferney-Voltaire, a tiny village in France, making it even more difficult for me to plan. Personally, I am not super happy with the bird we did, but he liked the outcome and recognized it straight away, even though during the run he couldn't figure out what we were drawing. I did get some satisfaction from being the only one who knew what we were doing and catching his surprised face expressions, whenever we would go in one direction and then abruptly turn back.

## Day 7. 30.09.2024 (cat, 12k)

![cat](/data/images/self-experiments/my_journal/cat.png)

This was my longest run ever after 10k that I had already got accustomed with. And since I love cats I was determined to find one in the map. Needless to say that it took me some time to plan it and still people don't always recognise the shape (it's a head of a winking cat, okay?). Anyway, I don't care, I love it.

Of course it couldn't be easy. I started my run in a wrong direction, which added uphill parts instead of downhill, turning a fourth of my run into a walk. But I'm still proud of myself. Even when I reached 12k I continued just to complete the drawing.

## Day 8. 06.10.2024 (dude, 15k)

![lion](/data/images/self-experiments/my_journal/dude.png)

I think my pareidolia tends to focus on finding human faces. When I was a child, I would stare at our ceiling in the bathroom while taking a shower and would see faces staring back at me. It comes with no surprise that when searching for a familiar shape in the map human silhouttes come easier to me.

I was extremely unmotivated for this run, which was supposed to be my longest run ever, 15 km this time. Already, I spent in total around an hour trying to come up with something near my home and failing. In the end, I am not sure what motivated me more to go out and start. Probably it was the need to prepare for my race in October. But I am certain that the only reason I completed this workout was due to the drawing I was doing. I really do not like running after all. So it is still a mystery to me why I keep doing it. Anyway, this is how another weird man in the streets was born.

## Day 9. 09.10.2024 (failed attempt)

It all just didn’t start well. I didn’t want to go, but then I had this very recognisable elephant run planned the night before. So I ended up going with little sleep, feeling extremely weak and wanting to give up straight away. Well.. I did give up 5k in, because of my stomach, who clearly wasn’t on my side this day. So, this was the first time when motivation to finish a drawing was not strong enough to continue. To be continued.

## Day 10. 11.10.2024 (house, 8k)

![house](/data/images/self-experiments/my_journal/house.png)

This was the day when motivation was very low. I needed to run, but I didn’t want to and especially not somewhere far. So, I came back to the shape that I had once considered doing, a house, a very questionable house with a weird roof. But hey, I did go out and I did complete it.

## Day 11. 14.10.2024 (lion, 16k, planned by Tim)

![lion](/data/images/self-experiments/my_journal/lion.png)

Today’s GPS-drawing was planned by Tim. It was a 16k lion spreading across the centre of Geneva. This saved me from spending hours trying to find an interesting route, but added additional challenges. Firstly, there was a subconscious pressure, since I knew how much work Tim puts into his routes and I didn’t want to let him down. So, I would spend extra time making sure I took the exact route he had chosen. And man, there are a lot of small streets here. Secondly, this was the first time I experienced how unstable GPS signal can be. Tim’s lion had some intricate details, mainly in the head, so they required some precision. Unfortunately, my GPS-track was all over the place, sometimes even passing over buildings, where I clearly did not run. No matter how hard I tried to run in the most straight way possible the lines turned to be very jagged. Thirdly, up until this point I had mainly run in the outskirts of Geneva, where there’re fewer cars and close to zero of traffic lights. This time, I was in the very centre of the city, meaning spending time waiting for the lights to change. I can’t really complain, because it allowed me to take a breath, but I did lose quite a lot of time.

The final result took me 1h 53mins to complete. Overall, even though it was interesting to run a professional gps-drawing for once, the additional pressure made it more stressful. And I think I just can’t really be proud of it, because after all, this wasn’t me who planned it, so I couldn’t take full credit. My drawings, though simple, remain mine and give me more pleasure once they are done. I’m proud that I ran 16k though, which is my longest distance so far.

## Day 12. 16.10.2024 (flamingo, 8k)

![lion](/data/images/self-experiments/my_journal/flamingo.png)

Combining writing a thesis with a regular running practice can be difficult. I still can’t find motivation to finish my elephant, because it’s so far away from my house. This is why I try to find closer routes, so that when I complete them I won’t have to come back in the dark. Yes, I’m still struggling with running in the morning. So, this time I found a bird shape that I believe to be a flamingo. Overall, it was an okay run, definitely faster and easier to do than the lion. It does bother me though that my works are incredibly simple compared to practitioners. GPS-drawings require a lot of dedication and imagination, especially if you want to do them at a good level.

## Day 13. 20.10.2024 (elephant, 9k)

![lion](/data/images/self-experiments/my_journal/elephant.png)

I finally finished the elephant. It was actually easier to run it this time, as I already knew half of the road and it saved me from constantly checking my phone. Definitely had more energy and felt much better. However, since it was away from home and I started my run late in the afternoon, I was finishing it in the darkness. But I think it was a meaningful ending to my experience - an elephant as the easiest drawing to find in the map according to Tim. Knowing that it was my last GPS-drawing before my half-marathon on Oct 27 encouraged me to try harder for this one, I even added an eye that I hadn't planned originally. Finishing my elephant was very satisfying.

## Thoughts

Rereading my notes now, I'm surprised and not surprised at the same time with how often I felt unmotivated to run. Clearly my GPS-drawings served as a strong motivation to finish my runs once I started, but I'm not sure they pushed me enough to go out. Most likely, it was mainly my thesis and half-marathon preparation that made all the work.

So would I continue doing them? Yes, but... It would probably be in the context of another race preparation. Unless, I fall in love with running and conquer my laziness. Also, it's super cold now. Ok, not super, but still cold, and I don't like running in cold weather. Alternatively, I would run a GPS-drawing with someone, but these people are yet to be found.

Overall, it was a cool experience and I will do it again. Peace.
