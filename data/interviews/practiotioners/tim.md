Well, before we start talking about GPS art, can you tell me briefly about how you started running, when and why?

I started running in my early thirties, just for general health and fitness, and that was, I guess, you know, not unlike how most people find running, and I've had a late life and I just try to be very good in social and competitive, and I don't know, I like the data, I like, you know, self -improvement, and you know, running is very easy to see how you progress, and when you are new to running in your thirties,

you progress for a long time, so that's pretty much, that's it. I think, like, I'm not super fast, you know, I'm not a lead athlete by any means, but I did not run at all when I was young, although I always played sports when I was young, but I never ran.

But I was running, I found running, I think, because where I was living at the time, I needed to get healthy, and there was no, like, groups.

Like, do you do any releases?

Yes, so I started, I mean, I think, I don't know when I started to race, but I started, after I was running for a little while, I started to join some races and I really liked the community aspect of that.

I think that's when I realized that you can, you know, at local running events, you can meet people in your neighborhood to, you know, to meet different groups of people and participate in more of a community thing.

But I didn't really start to race seriously until I joined a running group, which was many years later. I mean, I was, I was racing with a very small group of people where I was living before and then when I moved to London, I joined a running club and they're, the running club is racing all the time, you know, there's weekly runs and so, so I started racing in, you know, much more seriously, I started racing in,

in, I guess like in 2017 or 2018, something like that.

Thank you.

2010, I think, or maybe 2009, but I was never really serious about racing until much later.

So now you are and you do races regularly.

i'm actually injured at the moment so i'm not actually racing right now uh... i'm not really training very much right now uh... but uh... i hope i just got cleared by the uh... doctor to start uh... getting back to uh...

regular running so that's that's good

Mm -hmm.

How did you learn about Strava art at first?

you know it's so it's so i think it was so um i think it was quite common for people like me to find uh strava art and that was because of it was really just because of covid um i'm in a i'm in a running group and you know in london uh oh i was i'm working from home all the time and i i'm in a running group and you know people were we were allowed to go you know for runs with other people so we could meet up with people and um but you know when you're in a group of people who are serious runners and they you know they have like real they really depend on the community for like group runs and uh but since they were all sort of banned but you could still meet up with people and go for a run i think we um we were just looking for something different to do without you know everybody here does park run or everybody here does you know the everybody was training for marathons and we were i think we were just bored really and um i think somebody in the group had had heard about it and done a couple as kind of um just for fun and to be honest i thought it was really silly and um i never thought i would do it um but i also had this weird strange feeling that i would be good at it so uh i eventually i tried it and the look i i i finally came around to trying it because we were it was locked down and we were looking for activities to do with the kids and so we took out a map and we just started tracing lines on the map to see what we could find um but then i started doing it to make jokes and um so like i think the first one i did was a donkey um just because i wanted to make a joke about uh an ass in my um i don't know if that i don't know if that's funny to you but um yeah it's uh because the word is you know the word in english is you can say a donkey or you can say an ass which is you know i don't even know why that's true but uh you can say an ass and people will know that you're talking about a donkey or you're talking about somebody's butt you know so i think my first one was a straw title that said like look at my ass or something i can't remember what i wrote but uh so that was i just thought it was something to make a joke about and uh and then i just i got hooked though i really got hooked and you know i still do it now like it's been i started in 2020 i guess and i still i still do it all the time it's become like it's become like doodling it's like uh like uh yeah i do it like um i do it when i'm trying to relax i do it when i'm um when i'm on like you know like if i was talking to you for example i might just i might just pull up a map and uh just kind of look at it and uh i just kind of because it helps me um in a weird way it helps me focus actually so uh because it it you know like we're have you ever been in class taking

Yeah.

notes and you just you just need to kind of occupy your hands in a way that helps you I don't know that's what it is for me and so like a lot of times I'm on a call and I'll just be I'll just pull up a map and draw something and now I've got this like I've got I mean just really like thousands and thousands and thousands of of either you know drawings that are finished or drawings that are almost finished or or drawings that are just really bad but it's just like you're like I think

Okay, and like, do you just use paper maps or like Google Maps or how do you use it? I use Google Maps.

Thanks for watching. Thanks for watching. Thanks for watching. Thanks for watching.

Okay, so do you like more the process of like doodling and creating a Strava art route or writing it and finishing?

Well, I'm at a point now where I can't possibly run all the ones that I've drawn, so I started to send them to people to do, and a lot of times people ask me to do something in another city and I do them for that, but I see them as two separate things.

There are some that I'm really proud of the actual art, and then there's some that I'm just really proud of the run itself because it's a fun route in London, or I saw some cool things where I run with a friend, and so I started organizing a lot of the runs, just specifically to meet up with people, and so I started organizing different...

during COVID we had all these opportunities to run with groups of six or a group of one, and so we did all these group runs together, and so I did... we did a relay, and each person did a leg of the octa...

There is like an icon, well I'm from the laptop, but there is like an icon at the bottom, it's like a rectangular with an arrow that goes out, I don't know if you have it.

Let me see if I can find it.

First I want to find the dry.

maybe you can like just send me a screenshot or an image on instagram or i can give you my whatsapp

Hang on, I've almost got it figured out. Thank you. yeah i've done so many now it's like uh i can't even keep track let's see okay that now sound the drawing and now let's see if i can show the screen the dot dot dot you said uh

Yup. Wow. Can you see it?

Yeah. Yeah. So that was a, that was a relay race with 50 people. Wow. So, so we started at the green dot.

Thank you.

and two people ran the head and then they after about after about 10k we met you know i gave two other people a time to meet us at that point and then they met us at that point and then they did another 10 or 15k and then they met another two people because we were at the time we were in kova we were allowed to run with another person

Mm -hmm.

And we just, you know, I think we did it in 20 stages. No, that's not right. I can't remember exactly how it worked. But I think the information is in that post on Instagram. So I did that one. That was one of the group runs we did.

This was a group run. Can you see this one here with the dog?

Yeah.

So this this was also a group run, but it was this one, I actually ran the whole thing. However, everybody else ran a section of it. And we made it into like a like a competition. I don't it's, it's, I don't even know how to explain this to somebody.

But like, with I set up these, this is how bored we were in COVID. But there was, I think another 50 people did this run, but they each did a section of this. And then I went around. And I found like, all these sort of like things on the on the on the road to like, that was like an easter egg.

And I took a photo of something. And then I asked people to look for that as they went around. And, and then we just had like these, we made up these silly rules. And we made the we made the run into like a game.

And it was like all about like, who took the best photo and like, you know, strong was like, you know, so I said a bunch of segments on there. And, you know, you could you could run a segment really fast.

And then like, I don't know, then like during, you know, then afterwards, we have an award ceremony. And it was really silly, but really fun. So like, for me, it was, it was for me, it was, it wasn't at the beginning, it wasn't about the art itself, it was more about the, you know, keeping people occupied during COVID.

And, you know, finding a way to have some fun during COVID. That's, that's what initially drew me to it. So we did, I think we did, like, here's what I mean, here's what I mean. So this one, so even though I did this whole thing,

Mm -hmm.

I had a bunch of people do like a variation of this dog so that we could create this animation.

Mmm, that's so cool.

Yeah, it was fun. And then like, this is it, it was doing a poo. Sorry, I forgot about that. And then so then I made a movie out of the whole thing. I forgot about this. Yeah, I'll send you the movie.

That's pretty funny. Because it might actually be posted on this. I can't remember. But yes, the might be the first it might be the first an only straw or a movie. Where is that thing?

And what is this account? Because I found you in different accounts, right?

I don't know, do you follow me on this?

No.

This is my only Instagram account.

Oh, yeah, all right. Yeah, I just confused your name with the name of the account. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah

Yeah, so I always I always thought I mean I always just thought it was funny right like I never really took it seriously So like my I always wanted to make a joke so this is the kinds of things I thought were funny I was never really trying to make good art This is you know something I did in France, and I just I always thought that was really funny This is another group run though these this dinosaur was one of so okay,

so I think another 50 people did this race and what we did was One group did this route

Mm -hmm.

And so I set up a WhatsApp group and everybody from the club joined and I asked people to volunteer to run, you know, a 21 kilometer route and then another one to run a 22 kilometer route and then a third group ran a 40 kilometer route and so there you go, that's like, that's what was just, it was just a silly thing to do but we made each one of these things into like a, I mean there's so much to tell you about it but I don't even know if this is what you're after but this was to me the funnest part was like we made these competitions about it and well the joke was the joke is that,

you know, because we're all runners, we're all of a sudden we're, you know, we're not able to compete, you know, nobody's able to race because all the races have been canceled but we were all like very well trained and ready to go for, you know, it was right at the beginning of marathon season and so we were all just really bored and we wanted to run so like I made these, I mean that's what they were,

they were just these fake competitions where like, you know, your time was part of the equation so like, you know, like I had all these different metrics and I made up all these like weighting, weighting criteria where you could, you could run fast but it didn't really matter unless you took a good selfie, do you know what I mean?

So like, you know, we had like this judging panel and we were just being really silly, just really, really silly and it was a lot of fun and that's, I think we did about, I think in the end we did about seven or eight of these sort of group runs so there was, I haven't thought about the, yeah, so I don't know, this, I mean it's kind of embarrassing now to tell you about this but all my jokes, all of my,

I mean almost all of my struggle art is meant to be a joke, right? So like this one, for example, it's a beaver and I don't know if this translates at all for you. That's a word in English that, you know, has a couple different meanings, I'll just say that.

Mmhmm.

uh it's uh and it's it's kind of crude beaver can mean a lot of different things other than the animal so all right so let me actually you know what i better do is better if i said are you are you on strava

Yeah.

Okay, so when you go to Strava and you, you know, you get kudos, right? And, um, I better, I better do a search for this. It'd be easier to explain if I find it. How do I search for these things? I don't remember.

Yeah, we do. Okay. So if I search for beaver, so I've done now like one.

Oh, they are all yours.

Yeah, I've done a lot. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. I've done eight beavers. Um, so this is the first one I did, but actually, this is when I realized that when you do, when you do a beaver, um, hang on.

What do you do a beaver? Um, let me show a good one. Okay, here, here's a, here's a beaver, right? What do you call a beaver in, uh, in, uh, in French or in, uh,

In French, to be honest, I have no idea. I know in Russian.

so this is a see how I titled this thing your little beaver yeah when when you when Strava says Dasha gave you or sorry Daria gave you kudos on it then inserts the title of your of your activity yeah so this to me during lockdown was the funniest thing I cannot tell you how hard I laughed at this but okay so maybe this joke isn't gonna gonna work now but so beaver in English also means a lady's a woman's body or okay it's it's slang for yes got so so when you title it your little beaver and you have a lowercase Y at the beginning of the title Strava then says to Rima Harris and 16 others gave you kudos on your little beaver but then when somebody comments on that then so this is one of our runners in the group Karima so she so she commented on that and then she got a message when somebody else commented on it that said you know Jessica commented on your little beaver

Okay, I see.

And so I was, I don't know, I mean, that's how bored we were, but I cannot tell you how good that was for everybody. Like we were all sharing these images of people. Let's see if I have any. There's another beaver.

Thank you. That one actually I didn't do somebody else right in that Well, anyway, I think you get the idea so all of them though were Were meant to be oh so here here's another one Say it's the same joke, but with a different

okay i see do you get it yes you get it

I'm sorry, it's so crude, but to me, that's what was funny, so when you titled, so all day long I was getting these messages, you know, like so and so gave you kudos on your magnificent... Anyway, that probably tells you a lot about me, probably more than you want us to know, but yeah, that was the joke.

We just thought it was really funny and I felt like I cracked the code of Strava because yeah, it was just really funny, like...

Mm -hmm.

Oh yeah, so like, so we would just share these in the WhatsApp group. And 12 others gave you kudos on your magnificent car. So, okay, so this is what I was, why I'm bringing this up is because for me at the beginning, that's what it was.

It was a joke. It was, it was meant to be, for me it was meant to be silly. And it was also a way to like, get people together for these kind of silly runs we did. And then, eventually I ran out of those sort of expressions, you know, like beaver and cock.

And then, there's a couple others that I probably shouldn't show you. But anyway, that was the, that was why I got into it. But then, eventually I started like really finding the process of drawing really satisfying.

The, you know, being able to complete these things. It was really, it's really, it's really, I just finished one the other day and I was like, wow, this is really, it's really good. How did that, how was that just there all this time?

And, you know, like, you know, it's, they're not, they're really not easy to do. They're like, they're solving a puzzle. And then, like, you know, I, sometimes I spend, you know, many, many months on a drawing.

I know that there's, I know that there's something there. I know that, like, I found the basic shape and the basic outline and, but it just takes forever to get it to a point where I'm happy with it.

And, you know, just like anything else that you do, you do, you do something and it's like just an idea or a concept. And then you revisit it and then at some point you get frustrated because you're not making any progress on it.

And then it's because you realize that, like, you just need to take a step back. And then, you know, a few weeks later or even a month later, you go, oh, I'll just do that. And then, and then, and then you, you know, you just kind of strip away.

It's, but, but it's, so at some point I became like really kind of into that process of, you know, like, like you would do anything else. Like if you're writing something that's important to you, you, you write some notes, you read it, you hate it, you edit it, you, you write it again.

You just, you go back and do some more research. And so it just became for me, it just became like that for, for a lot of different things. And I mean, I've been working on one now for like, it's going to be great, but I've been working on it for nearly a year now.

Wow. But it's not, not, not like every day, but just, you know, I started it and I, you know, at one point I spent like, you know, I worked on it nonstop for like, you know, like, like a whole day. I just couldn't get it anywhere.

And then, you know, I revisit it every now and then. And I know it's, I know it's going to be good, but, and actually I'm done with it now. But then you go, actually, now that I've done it, how am I going to find the time to actually, to run it?

You know, some of them are quite long now. They get longer and longer as I do it more because I get, I get, they just get more detailed. And then, and then other times, like the one I just finished the other day, I, I was really just messing around.

And I was kind of put, I had like a, I drew like a lion a long time ago and I was just kind of messing around with it. And it turned into something really cool. And now I want to go do it, but I'm injured.

So I'm, you know, probably not going to be able to get to do it for a while. I might cycle it, so that would make it easier. But yeah, I'm really, really quite fond of this one. And, and that one only took like, because I had already found like the base, I already had the base of the drawing from something else I was working on.

Do you mind turning off our share screen so that I can see you?

Oh, sure, sure, sure.

and you're still here.

Yeah, I'm still here, but I can't find-

top stop sharing

Oh, there it is. Thanks.

So just so that I understand better your process, so like you use Google Maps, but then do you take like screenshots and then you move it like to Photoshop, I don't know what, and then you trace there with a pencil or how do you do it?

So, like, in the end... In the... in the what?

in the application itself.

Yeah, in Google Maps, I use my desktop computer mostly. Occasionally, I do everything on my desktop. Occasionally, I use Strava. Sometimes, I use this on Strava. So drawing doesn't work on Google on your phone.

But on Strava, you can use the routes. If you have a premium membership on Strava, you can use the routes. It's pretty good. So whenever you're just going through your Strava scene, looking at what your friends are doing, most of the people that I follow in Strava are people in my local area, in London and mostly my running club, which is all really quite local.

So when I'm going through the scene of all the maps, if they've done something that looks like something,

Mm -hmm.

I'll just go to the, I'll just go to, I'll just save that as a, as a, as a root. Um, cause you can, you can, yeah, from the mobile app, you can, you can click save to root and then once you save it to your root, you can edit it.

And it's, it's, it's not, it's not, it's not good for, um, it's not good for detailing, but it's a good way to just sort of capture like a shape. Cause most of the time what I'm just looking for is a, is a shape.

Once you have, once you have a shape, like a, like a circle, um, you know, and I, I'm really not an artist. I, I'd never, I'm a terrible, terrible drawer. I was never able to draw when I was a kid. So like, I, I, I don't, I don't know anything about art theory or anything like that, but I suspect that, um, you know, when you, when you start to draw an animal or, or something, you, you make like a circle and then you kind of,

um, yeah, like, yeah, the pencil and you just kind of, and then you just kind of get the shape down and then that's what I'm looking for. So what I'm looking for is, you know, somebody in the neighborhood doing like a five or 10 K loop that looks like a circle and then once you find the circle, you kind of look around.

Cause if you, if you have a sense of the scale, I guess it's five or 10 K you go, okay, well that's, I can run that. And, uh, and if I just find some legs and, and you know, I'll be able to, so, so my, my Strava roots page is full of sort of, um, uh, just other people's runs that I thought were looked like something.

And then what I'll do is, um, I'll go through those and then I'll, you can download the GPX from Strava and then, and then upload that into Google maps. And then you can, and then it's much easier to work with there.

Okay.

off sorry your video is awful I don't see you I don't know why

Thank you. Thank you.

Oh yeah there it is. Yeah okay sorry. Yeah so that's uh that's that's what I do now. I think when I first started uh I was with my yeah when we first started doing it we were I was literally printing off maps of the neighborhood and then I was using my daughter and I were using a pencil to to just draw over the maps that's how we that's how I started but yeah um it doesn't it just it just um it it it doesn't work it takes uh it takes too much uh although that's what um I think there's uh there's another guy that does it he's I think he told me recently that he still uses a pen on a on a map but I you would have to like really have a you'd have to either really have a lot of printed maps or you could like overlay something that you could like clear off um but um for me like once I figured out how to do it in google maps it just became like the way uh also like you know um it's so often that you're drawing something and on a printed map you wouldn't be able to zoom in and see if you can actually uh you know pass that road or if there's a gate or if uh but but in google you can see everything so um you really you really need to zoom in a lot

yeah and so now you like mostly do animals

Yeah, so animals are, I think the only thing that really, really works on Strava, I've, I have done, so, I don't know if you, I don't know if you've thought about this at all, but, so, it's all about scale, right, like, you know, on a big enough map, you can draw whatever you want, so, like, if you took all of

Um...

But I can't run that scale. And the only thing that works in a running scale are very, very simple shapes.

Mm -hmm.

Um, and you know, the only people who do anything else are doing it on a bigger scale. So, um, you know, there's like, um, there's a couple of guys that, you know, want, like are trying to do like a perfect circle and you can do a perfect circle once the scale gets really, really big, but you cannot do it.

In a 10 K it's, it's almost impossible to get a good looking circle in a 10 K. Um, and so for me, I've always been a runner and so I never really thought of myself as doing anything other than that, but there's a guy, you know, um, there's people who do like portraits that are, that are, that they look nice, but they would not be possible on a running scale.

They're only possible when you're talking about two or 300 kilometers or at least a hundred kilometers. Um, so, so for me, um, for what I, what I'm capable of as an athlete is, is running. And sometimes, you know, I used to, I was, when I was really doing this a lot, I was running, you know, more than 40 K to get a drawing done.

Um, and, um, there's a guy in San Francisco. He's a runner. He's like an ultra marathoner and you've probably seen him. He's quite famous, but his runs are all much, much longer. They're very good, but they're much, much longer.

And, and he's doing it on a, on a, on a grid. So on a, on a, when the scale is big enough in a grid city, you could do whatever you want. uh... i think was more interesting to me uh... i did this right i set out to do it uh...

i went to so i live in london and it's not a good city but it's a very good city for strawberries very the rosary dance there's lots of like sweeping arts and uh... there's lots of these wonderfully curved lines and it's sections of grids so you can it's a really great city for uh...

for drawing but uh... it's also uh... limiting in a way but on a big american grid city if you if you started at a scale where you just committed to drawing like more than fifty k you can pretty much draw whatever you want

Thank you.

So there's variations of these people. And he draws, I mean, he mostly draws animals too, but, and again, I think it's just because everybody knows what an animal looks like. You know what I mean?

Yeah.

What you don't want the worst thing that can happen is if you draw something and people say is that a what is that? That's the worst what is that is that a

And so.

Thank you.

so that's that's the I think people have to like because you're limited right you even though even though the scale even though when you get the scale quite big you still you're still so Strava is a one -line thing right so you can't do anything other than you know you can't you can't uh join up two things without there being a line connecting them and so so every time every time I'm drawing something and I think there's something interesting there and I want to do something really detailed to make it work it never works because it's at some point it's just it just has to be simple for it to look good on on the screen

Mm -hmm.

I don't know, it's really, really hard to explain, but that's why, I think that's why I do animals, also just because, I mean that's where I started, that's what the joke was always about, I was always making that joke, I've done a couple things that aren't animals I think, I've done some, I've done a few hearts, I've done a few, you know, very simple shapes, and a few people, but nothing, and I did draw,

I drew a portrait of somebody that I haven't run yet, but it's just too long, and I,

But, you know, another life hack for getting a perfect drawing is running in the place where there are no streets. Like, there is this guy, whose name is Gustave, I don't know, I don't remember who. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

I get from Brazil.

Thank you.

Yeah, I know him very well, I mean we communicate a lot through Instagram and I agree.

That's kind of like cheating, I would say.

Wha-

because I think it's goose thought yeah we we we talk all the time although I haven't in a while because I've not really paying attention but anyway yes so he runs on the sand on a sand dune and he can do whatever he wants but this is this is this is a different thing and it's it's not cheating it's different it's a different creative process so he and then he figures out how to go draw it and then and then put that map onto the dune create a GPX track out of it to follow it so his process is entirely different than in my process my I don't set out to draw anything I look for shapes I never wake up and say I never I never wake up and say I'm gonna draw a line today that's just not how it works what happens is I see a shape I see something that looks interesting like the way a street goes you know and I start to play around it and I just see where that goes that's very it's a very different thing and also because of that he draws he draws I think sometimes he draws his own art but mostly what he does is he takes an image of something and traces that and then applies it it's not it's not his art and I don't mean to diminish it anyway it's just because what he does is really it's cool it's really clever and people really respond to it so it's just different and I would say the same thing about what a lot of us do I think what cyclists do for example is different and it's because of scale once you get on a bike your scale goes from you know you know being able to you know if you know if I can run 20k a cyclist can run or cycle you know 80k without any problems so the people who ride a bike they're doing a little bit like Gustav is doing it they have something in mind that they want to do and then they just go do it because they have the scale but that is not what runners do runners or people who think in terms of like you know between 10 miles and 30 miles they have to like they have to be able to do it within that scale and I think that's why we end up doing a lot of animals because it's the only thing that really works on that scale that looks like a drawing but that that's it I never I never set out to do the thing that I finished the other day it started I thought it was gonna be like a monkey at first and then it and then it just kept changing and changing and it turned into something completely different so I think that's I think that's fundamentally different however I I I also wanted to so we're you know we're also I don't know if you know this but we're also quite competitive like we we with each other like you know in like a friendly way like

Like who's travel artist? Yeah, yeah. I know that there is like an award or prize like the best travel artist of the year.

Yeah, it's funny, I was nominated last year for...

Yeah, I saw on you.

So that was on a bike, actually, because I was injured. And I just wanted to do something really big. And a couple of times I wanted to just kind of point out that you can do whatever you want once you start thinking on a bigger scale.

But also, that was another group run I did. I'll show you. I'll show you. Or do you have my Instagram account handy?

Yeah.

Actually, I don't even know how I'm going to find it. Maybe I'll just, maybe I'll just send you an image real quick. That's what I'll do. I'll just send an image.

Do you like more GPSRs made by running or by cycling?

So for me, like, running is my, is my, I like to, I like to, but again, I see them as separate things. Like, um, you know, I, I find them to be more satisfying when I've run them. Because it's harder.

They're harder. Yes. But they're, the, the getting a run done, I find afterwards, I find that to be much more rewarding than getting one done on a bike because of all those things that I've told you, it's like, it's almost too easy.

This is, I don't, uh, yeah, that's what it is. It's too easy. When you, when you start to, when you start to draw on like the, you know, around 200 kilometers, the, it just becomes really easy. So cycling them doesn't really.

Also, also physically, you know, when you're running, you're running, you're looking at a map, you're following in the directions, but you're running is, is, is, is actually running to get it done. When you're cycling, I would say that you're not really getting any exercise.

Wow.

because I mean very very very very basic exercise when you when you cycle and you're you're you're going too fast to be able to you have to slow down so that you can make all the turns that you have to make you're not you're not getting your heart rate high so physically you're just out there to do the drawing because you know unless you program in every turn into your bike computer and you have the bike in here you know tell you turn here turn there which I don't think most people do I think they I think they just follow it on on on their map but I don't I don't know is that I've only done a few I don't know what the psych was to got to ask Anthony Hoyt about what he does but he I think he does it like I do it because I talked with him every now and then because when I I'd never done on a bike and so I reached out to him to find out how he did it and and he just told me what he does I pretty much do the same thing so I just um but but you because you're going so much faster on the bike and because you're turning so often you're not actually cycling for at that point you're not cycling for fitness you're just out you're just out on a long bike ride where you're constantly stopping and starting but on a run you have you have just more time to like see you in the next turn is and make sure you're getting it right it's but you're still running you're still doing your easy pace and you're still getting getting around it so I would say that just they're just more satisfying running

Mm -hmm.

Yeah, I was looking for a photo, but actually, I don't even know how to...

Mm -hmm.

Okay. So where did I do that? That was in, that was in, um, so this was another group activity that we did. I forgot about this one until you, until you brought up the, um, Gustav thing. So he inspired me to do what, what was, what I thought was impossible, which was, so I run in this group called the Queens Park Harriers, which is my local running group.

And, um, people had asked me to do our logo, our group, a run a run club logo. And it was impossible because it's letters.

Mm -hmm.

and when you have letters oh look I said this one to a guy in India asked me to do a to do a drawing so I sent him this one. Did he like it? so this one I really I really I really love this one I did this on a bike though but so this is this little tiny boat is is where I live and then at the you see how this is a straight line

Mm -hmm.

So I stopped my watch up here, and then I rode down here and restarted it down there. And then did the shark. Where is that drawing that I did for? Why can't I not see it? Thank you. I just wanted to show you that I'm not posted, I'm sure I posted it, it should be somewhere near.

Oh yeah, so this is what I meant by like the group runs, you can do these, so at one point we all started at the same place, we all started and finished at the same place but we each did a different drawing and then we had lunch together and some people went to different places that day and so I drew one in Germany and then I made a competition out of it like I do with all of them but yeah, we all finished at the same place and I had lunch together so I wanted to see if I could draw multiple drawings from the same start and end point and so I was just experimenting with that and then I sent out all the runs to people and then we did that.

Also, it's you who planned the drawings.

Yeah, I drew all of them.

Oh, okay.

Hmm, where is my Queens Park logo? Thank you. I'm sorry, I can't find it, but anyway, Gustav made me realize that you could draw on an open field, you could draw whatever you want, and it would be impossible to draw this logo without either one of two things, without the scale being so big that you could make it look like the letters, or you do it in an open field, and that's what I did in an open field.

Bye.

But I can't find it, sorry.

Did you like it less than like your usual...

Oh yeah, so I also turned that into a, now I gotta tell you about it because it's really a good one actually. I really liked it. Hang on a second, I know I have it. I just don't know. I guess maybe I posted it in a different part of the

Maybe you can find it on your Strava.

Mmm.

ayyyyyyyyyyy

there it is okay so this one um now this is a it's only 5 .65 kilometers um and at that scale you could never draw something on you can never draw something this detailed when you're constricted by the streets right you just you just and the same applies um you know you know up to really like i could probably have drawn something maybe close to what this looks like if you increase the scale to so that that's that's our logo so um so our logo is there

Mm -hmm.

So I drew this, and I think I even talked to Gustav about how he did it to make this work, but what I did was I drew the route. I invited everybody to come and run the route. And so this is where I think Gustav is really, it's what he does is really cool.

Even though the art is trace or it's, you know, it's the physical and mental dedication you have to do to actually trace this route is one of the, it was one of the hardest things I ever did. So what I asked other people to do was I invited all these runners and I set up this, I set up a tent in the middle of this field and I invited all these other runners to come in and I sent them the map and I said,

you know, you'll win points if you do this, this and this. And so they all came and they ran this and they did a terrible, terrible job. Really, really, really, really bad. And some people did like, you know, you can get points for being extra silly and it was just this big, you know, big laugh.

But it was this drawing here is me actually doing it. But the only way you could actually do this is by walking it. It's impossible to run. It's impossible to run this. And that's why Gustav isn't running it.

He's just out in the, you know, he's out on that dune and he's just like, he's watching every step he takes and making sure that every step he takes is on that track. And if you look at his statistics, he's out there for hours and hours and hours.

It is really not easy to do. And I can, I can, I can tell you because everybody that tried it. So this is not perfect, but this was by far, mine was by far the best. And if you saw what other people did, it was hilarious.

Let me show you. Oh my goodness. Where did I, where did I say that? So that was pretty sure I, I know. It's in, it's in reels. That's why. That's why it was in my reels.

So you didn't run until you walked it.

yeah it was it would be and and Gustav because because it's it's a sand dune he's not running either he's he has to walk um and it's very hilly sand dune and uh so he's but it's it would be it would be impossible to run that deep that detail of a shape in such a small um on such a small distance uh because you know you you have to like check the map and if you're running and it's just it's just too hard to sort of you know make sure that you're always on the track

Mm -hmm

Um, I have it here in my photos. Thank you. So another one I did, I sent a bunch of, I drew a bunch of hearts, do you remember Grenfell? Well, in London there was a building that burned down, it was like seven years ago now, but the symbol became a green heart, so I sent a bunch of people green hearts and they did that.

That was a good one, but what was I doing? Oh look, here's all my Strava art images. So this one, right, I did in Los Angeles because that's where I'm from.

Mmm.

It was 135 kilometers. I ran it, but I ran it in over the course of four days, I think, or five days maybe. Because at that scale, you know, you just have to either cycle it or break it up over a few days.

But what was I looking for? Yeah, so another time we went and got tacos. We all met up and we, same, same thing as I before, but the last one was hanging. We each did, so everybody did their own drawing that I sent them.

There it is, the logo project. So these are all the ones that my fellow runners did.

Yeah. Yours is crazy.

did I do that part again and everybody did a really really bad job I mean that's just ridiculous right anyway that that's that's what I think that's what's really interesting about what Gustav does but but the thing is is when you know I don't do this anymore but when I first started you know people go nuts when Gustav posts they they love it right they really they really think it's really cool and but the number of times people have said to me have you seen this or this is you know this is good but have you seen this and I I think I think a lot of people don't even realize that they're two completely different things what he does is very very different his process is totally different the rules are very different and even it's not just me it's like I mean I'm definitely I'm definitely one of the one of the more productive guys out there but there's a there's a couple like you know real real famous people that do this now and if you look at their feeds in Strava when they when somebody posts something almost inevitably somebody says like there's a guy a guy a guy named Lenny in San Francisco he's got thousands of followers and almost anytime he posts something somebody says have you seen what Gustav did and and and it's you know again like I think what he does is incredible and because I know how hard it is and how much how much time he dedicates to it and also just like the mastery of GPS and all that stuff and just like understanding how like you know to get the roots on it it's it's really it's really incredibly does but most people just don't know and most people don't know that you know cycling is a different thing than running it I think I think I think I think the I think the best ones are are less than 20k and I think I think it would be really hard for you know I think it's really hard to do anything that looks like anything less than 20k I think that's probably the hardest the hardest thing you can do in Strava or anything that's less than 20k that that looks like something is is a real victory

No, no, no. It's very interesting to listen to you. Do you mind stopping sharing and turning on your camera?

Peace.

No, no, no, it's okay. I've learned so much from you and I actually have a call with Gustav tomorrow, but now I guess I know that I'm not going to ask him a lot about running.

Yeah, no, he's, he's, what he does is very physical, like, don't get me wrong, he is out on a sand dune in the hot sun all day, you know, if you look at his, if you look at the actual time it takes for him to do a drawing, he is standing on, he's walking around that sand dune for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours.

For everyone, he's out there all day long. So that is like a level of dedication that I don't think anybody really, and because he's so productive, he's done, he's done a lot, he's done more than, you know, he's done more than most, but, you know, all, all, but like I said, like, they're just different, right?

Like, because he can draw whatever he wants, he doesn't have to spend so much time drawing. For me, like the, the hard part in the beginning was, you know, finding something to draw, like I would, if I drew something, I would run it, but I was only able to, I was only able to, once I drew that, I didn't have anything else.

Now, now I, now I, I have a lot of drawings that I'll never get to because I've got when you can take any drawing that you want to do, like if you want to, you know, trace an image of somebody onto a tune, you can, I, I, I imagine Gustav now can probably do a drawing in probably a few minutes, really.

He can, he can probably, so I'm not, I'm not an artist and I, I, I don't, I don't, it's, it's a really weird thing, like, it's like, it's like, for me, it's more like puzzling, I think, like you're just kind of, you're kind of occupying your brain and you're kind of trying to solve a puzzle, but I, I, I really mean this.

I think, I think that if you ask me to draw a dog or a lion, I don't think I could draw one with a pen and pencil better than I can do one in a, on a map.

Are you going to use some references to draw it on a map or are you just going to imagine a lion and then...

I really liked and I don't even think I could draw it on a piece of paper.

But like, did you have, like, photos of lions when you were, like, in New York?

When I'm drawing, when I find something that I like, and I think it's going to be something like, if I go, okay, this looks like it's going to turn into a lion, and I like it, I'll then start googling images of lions and, you know, that is really strange too, that the actual, so the first thing you do is you Google images of lions, and then you go, actually, those don't look like lion drawings, they look like real lions,

but then there's a difference between what a drawing of a lion looks like and what a real lion looks like, which is not something I was prepared for, and then you've got to like take into account that, you know, you can't, you have to have a continuous lion, and so you, it becomes more like an animation style.

Could you tell me what is your profession because you keep saying that you are not an artist but currently you have like some creative

I've always been in a creative space. I studied journalism at university and I've always worked for, I started in my early career, I started in news media and I'm now into the companies I work for, I now use a lot of, well, I mostly write and I use writing to sell and I use sort of general, my design skills for packaging corporate information to help companies sell themselves.

So it's like, it's business development. I work on a lot of proposals. it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just,

Mmm.

I hope so, so the business.

Yes, that's the issue.

Well, thank you. Thank you.

Yeah, it's not real, it's not-

So I wanted to ask, you said that you kind of started GPS art just for fun, to show silly jokes and all. But I saw in your post that you also do some events to support something. There was a reindeer runner for children with cancer.

yeah that's that's right so um that's right so i think i think there's like i think that is for me like the next sort of if i continue to do something like this it's uh so i've done i've done two um i did the grand feld the grand feld tower memorial um where i drew a bunch of hearts um and i gave those hearts to the community who was affected by the fire and then and then they ran that one and it was it was it was really just to sort of like you know remember the remember the disaster and like you know get people together so that was really i was really proud of that one and then but it was very simple and then the one that you're talking about actually is um a ranger the reindeer run how did that work um so i didn't i contributed to um another guy asked me another guy who ran who runs that charity asked me to help and so i drew a bunch of reindeer and i gave them to people who wanted to run one

Mm -hmm.

that and then and then I asked I asked everybody to donate money to the to the cause so we raised a little bit of money not a lot but his it wasn't just me I think I think some other people in London also I don't know his name but on Instagram is rootopia I think R -O -U -T -O -P -I -A rootopia so he organized it asked me to draw some reindeer and I gave those around of this and actually I hope I hope we do it again this year because I ended up doing a lot of reindeer I grew a lot of reindeer but the other there's another guy Jarek which you probably probably heard of Jarek he's a he's another guy he's another guy in London and he he probably his primary motivation I mean you have to ask him because I've only met him once but on Instagram it looks like his primary motivation is using Strava art for for helping helping people and he's managed to raised a lot of money for it but I think I've always wanted to kind of figure out how to do how to do that and it's it's identical what else have I done there like that actually oh actually somebody just asked me to do so I'm drawing somebody asked me somebody in a you know in an animal conservation program asked me to draw some giraffes to help raise money for and I can't remember the name of the group but they just to rescue or supports the giraffe the drafts in Africa and so there's a group in London that that is Ross I'm drawing a bunch of giraffes and hopefully we'll get some people to draw to run them and raise some money

Thanks.

Mm -hmm. What was the name of this guy? Jericho?

Get J -E -R -I -C and then his last name is Y -U -E -N.

Oh wait, is it like the code something, code runner? Yes, exactly. Oh yeah, I'm following him. Yeah, it's okay.

So he's really, I don't know, so he was able to, so he's also a London bass, but you'll see, but I think, so because he's in a lot of, he's in a lot of big running groups here, so he had like a lot of exposure, and I think he started right at the beginning of, I think he started quite early in this, and because he connected to, I think he was really smart because he connected to that sort of, he connected the Strava art to helping raise money for people,

and I think that really worked. I think he did a really good job sort of marketing himself, but, and if you look at what he does, like that's really his motivating factor. I mean, mine was not that, his was always,

yeah and uh like if we talk about motivation but more like motivation for running do you think GPS art is something that may help with it i mean it sounds like for you like you don't really have problems with motivation you're running just for fun and doing it for fun what about other people

I think there have been times where it has been really motivated.

Mmm.

to run because it's uh, a drawing, um, I think, I think with running, so are you a runner? Sorry, I haven't even, are you um

Well, yeah, I'm actually preparing for my first half marathon and I find that GPS art actually helps to run when I don't want to run.

So I, I think about this a lot and there's times where if you're running, you know, running, you know, this, I've been running for a long time. I've been running for like 15 years now and I've been running for in that time.

You run for different reasons, right? You, you run because you want to lose some weight. You run because you, you want to, um, you know, just general fitness. You run because you're, you're bored or then you start to run because you want to get better and race.

Now, when I was training for a marathon, I didn't really want to do any. Strava art, but if you're not training for something, it's, it can be, it can be hard to get out the door, just to, just to go for a run without real, at different times in your life, like you don't, um, you don't really want to just go for a, just go for a run.

So what motivates people is, you know, connecting, meeting people when you're not training for anything, you have, you have to find a different reason. And, and, and sometimes for me, that reason actually has been to do a drawing.

Um, uh, and, uh, I think, uh, and then there's also times where like, so there's a lady in our group and, uh, she was having a hard time doing her long runs during her training for a, for a marathon.

And she asked me to draw a bunch of roots for her and, and that motivated her. Um, just, you know, cause when you just, when you start to train for a half marathon or a marathon, you know, Sunday rolls around, you're tired and the schedule says you got to go to 15, 20 K and you're just bored of the same route and you're just, you're, you're, you're tired when you, when you have like, you know, somebody plans a roof for you and somebody,

you know, you're gonna, you, your mind isn't on the run. Your mind is on the map and like, you know, just kind of, it's, it's, you're still getting the aerobic workout. So I, I would say that, I would say that, uh, GPS does motivate me to run.

And I know that it motivates other people to run. I know that the art does help, uh, but when I'm trained personally, when I'm training for a marathon, I am much more by the book, like, like I want to do the miles, I want to, I want to, I want my mind to be on my pace and my, and my, um, so I'm, I'm very routine based when I'm training.

Like when I do, when I do like a marathon training program, I do the same run in the same place, the same time. And then when the weekend rolls around, I do the same long run, same place, same time. So during marathon training, I'm less inclined to do Strava art, but, um, just like right now, like I would much rather go out for a, to run like a dog or something, then they just do like a boring old dog around the neighborhood.

But you are not bored when you prepare for marathon and doing the same stuff every week.

but but but the motivation for me running a marathon is is there are people who run marathons just to just to do it they don't care about their time they don't but when I when I finally get to when I finally get committed to running a marathon I'm doing it because I want to push myself I want to go faster than I had done before and so the motivation for me is is doing the training so that I'm prepared for that and I think you know I think maybe that's that's not always healthy but like for me like I feel better on a marathon day when I've done the when I've done the work and I know that my you know my body can can can do that but with GPS running I I'm just not focused And I,

you know, if I, and sometimes they're quite long, so you don't want to run too long because it's not good for your body, right? So sometimes I'll walk a little bit and I'm just, and also you're always getting lost and you're always like, you know, you just don't want to miss the turn and so like you're always checking the map and you're always, so I just go much, much slower than I would if I was running for training or even just for a normal run.

I go much, much slower than on a GPS run.

Mm -hmm.

Yeah. So I have, I think I have just one little question left. What is delirium challenge? It's something with elephants.

Oh my goodness, I love this one so much. I love this so much. So it was actually like, I think it was last year at the end of the summer last year, I think. So, you know, all these people, there's a lot of people that do like straw bar competitions, right?

They announce something on, you know, their website, this is straw bar competition. And run this drawing, you know. So the delirium challenge was a beer company in Belgium, who their logo is an elephant.

And so the delirium challenge was to run an elephant. And they said, like, you have to run the elephant between this date and that date. And, you know, the winner gets a, you know, they listed a bunch of prizes and some of the prizes were pretty good.

Now, I thought it was funny. Again, this is because I think this is really funny. So first of all, an elephant, if you ever wanted, have you ever drawn a straw bar? Have you ever done straw bar? Yeah.

What have you drawn?

like a heart, a fish, like a profile of a man and I have prepared like a head of a cat and that's it. But it's very like basic and short distances.

I don't really know because they have a trunk, but I think it's because they're so big. I don't know what it is, but for me, I can draw an elephant. It's one of the very few things where I can actually just sit down and I can say, I'm going to draw an elephant, and I can actually draw an elephant.

Most of the other animals, they don't work out that way, but I don't know what it is about elephants. Anyway, so the delirium challenge, they posted this saying, they said, draw an elephant. I can't exactly remember this, but I'm in this local running group, and somebody said, they said, Tim, have you seen this delirium challenge?

You've got to run an elephant between this day and that day. But in the fine print on their website, it said, only eligible if you live in Belgium.

Mm -hmm.

thing is right like if you if you if a bunch of people just draw draw an elephant or an elephant and they give the prize in the end to a really bad elephant it's gonna look really bad so like I do I do it's so weird that I've never explained this to anybody because I'm in a running group where we we joke about this stuff all the time like in the in the I'm in a big running group but in that within that running group I'm in a little running group like a strong hard running group where we where we make where we make we know we we make jokes about about all this and so anyway the joke was even though you had to be indulgent to win we knew that we knew that any elephant that we did here in London would be better than what they did in Belgium just because just because of the scale and we just anyway so what I did I drew like I do like 50 elephants maybe even more I can't remember and I said anybody wants to run an elephant here's a bunch of elephants I posted all the elephants drawings and I think we ran like 20 20 elephants or something

Mm -hmm.

And I ran at least three of them, I think. And then the beer company just said, once you finish running your elephant, just tag us. And that's exactly what happened. Everybody that belched it, I did want.

It sounds really cocky, but they just weren't very good. And then every one that my club did, that I drew, was good. And so I knew that we would win. And then that they would have to change their competition because they couldn't give first prize.

So what they ended up doing was they just ended up giving everybody the same prize. And they shipped me a case of beer, and it was nice. But there's these competitions all the time. I think I've done, because we're quite competitive, right?

It's fun. But again, the competitions only work when there's strict rules. It has to be, for example, if you were doing a competition, and you said you have to run the best flamingo between this day and that day, there's no question that Gustav would do the best flamingo.

Mm -hmm.

No question, but that's not fair to somebody who's just trying to like draw a flamingo on the on the streets, right? So like you have to create different rules for different kinds of events and so you know you have to say like it has to be between 20 and 30 kilometers or no more than 30 kilometers or and or you can't do it on an open field you have to do it on streets or you have to you know there has to be some because there's no way to get a fair competition uh when you have all these I think of I think of these guys as like you know I think of Anthony Hoyt and um and Gustav and I think of them as like they're doing GPS art but they're doing it with different tools you know like the bike is a different tool the stand doing it that Gustav does it is a is a different tool or running it when your fee is a different tool if you're running ultra marathons to do them that's a they're it's like you know like one guy is using you know charcoal and one guy's using acrylic and you know they're just like they're just different mediums I think um so you have to if you're going to do a competition basically that's that was that was that was I was making a joke about the the the competition it's it's kind of it's just kind of stupid right the competition right um there's there's just no way like to do I don't know I don't I was really I did a couple competitions in the beginning and uh I was I you know I was uh really sort of um yeah so uh you know like there was a there was a there was a time where I was like well yeah Gustav his drawings are just better than everybody's it's true they're just better than everybody's but then you you go oh well that's because it's because it's um he took that he took a he took a photo and then he you know then he traced the photo and then um uh so so that's of course he's gonna win of course he's gonna of course his you know his flamingo is gonna be better than my flamingo and of course Lenny's in San Francisco of course his flamingo is gonna be better than my flamingo because his flamingo is 60 miles on a on a grid street in San Francisco yeah um so I think and then also like because because he's doing Lenny's doing it too Lenny does it too I think he does a mix um if you look at his stuff a lot of the things he does are traced he takes an image and and traces them onto the the streets of San Francisco

you

Um, and again, I, I, uh, I think that's unfair in a competition. Um, unless you, unless you classify it, right? Unless you say it has to be less than 30 K or whatever it is. Um, and it has to be an original drawing, but what, what, what, what that is, it's just different than what Jared does and what I do.

And, um, it's just a different, uh, it's just a totally different thing. So anyway, I think, I think early on I was into doing the competitions and then, uh, now I just don't have any interest in doing that unless it's to make like a joke, like we deal with the delirium challenge, which is basically just to make them, uh, realize what a, what a mistake they made by, by, by doing by limiting it to,

uh, people in Belgium. But, uh, anyway, I got a free case of beer out of it and that was, uh, that was fine, but I, if you ever get to London and, uh, want to run an elephant, I've literally got, I don't know, maybe a hundred elephants.

That's cool, maybe I will one day.

Yeah, there's a lot of elephants out there, they're everywhere, they're everywhere.

Maybe I should make an elephant of my own here in Geneva.

Yeah, actually, you know, I've never looked at Geneva, how are the streets in Geneva?

Complicated.

So another thing I do, which I find really fun, is somebody will tell me, like, I'm going to Japan, and I'm training for a marathon, and I want to, you know, can you look at the maps in Tokyo and draw some roots for me out there, and I've looked at, I've drawn things in so many different cities, uh, I've got, like, you know, really good drawings in Seoul and, uh, Tokyo and Amsterdam and loads of them in California,

all across America, and, uh, yeah, people would just say, you know, I'm going to go, I'm going to go, I'm going to go on a holiday here. Can you look at the maps? I'll send them something. And, uh, um, so, maybe I'll look at Geneva.

But do they give you the distance they want to run, or...

Yeah, they usually say, like the lady here who I did the training program for, she said, okay, on this weekend I have to run 20 kilometers, and this weekend I have to run 25, and, um, and, you know, she's like a, she was like a, she was like a superstar runner, where, you know, 30 kilometers was nothing to her, so, um, it was really easy to find a route for her, um, and, uh, and so, you know, a lot of these,

a lot of the guys that I run, you know, because I'm in this morning club, like a lot of these people who go to like, you know, they're going on holiday, they're, they're training for something, and they, uh, they, they need a 30 kilometer route on Sunday, and they, they just need to get it done.

So, um, so I, I'm always looking at different cities. That guy in India, he, um, he asked me to drop, I sent him a bunch of routes, uh, he's done two of them, I think, um, and I think, and then there's a guy in the

Those are the people that you don't know right and you do it for free

Those are the people I don't know. Yeah, I do it for free. I've never really thought about trying to make money out of this. But like I said, when I look at a new city, it's like finding a new puzzle.

It's just like the roads look different. And then it depends on the landscape too, right? It's a different challenge. In London, you've got a very, very big area. But in a smaller city, you have to find you're kind of limited by the shape.

So I travel a lot in France. And I was going on holiday every year in these small French towns where you were limited because you were on a peninsula or something. So you have to think about different animals.

If you're on a peninsula, you have to do penguins because they're standing up. So every time I look at a new city, you see different limitations, right? If you're limited by the sea, you have to, if it's just very narrow, you have to do an alligator or whatever it might be.

But I find that to be a fun challenge.

Well, if you ever make a GPS drawing for Geneva, I would be happy to run it.

Will start I will start I will start looking at Geneva because if you if you would want to run one

but like I'm a bit limited in terms of distance.

What's your max distance?

So far it's been only 10, but since I'm running half marathon in four weeks, well it will be up to 20.

It's been a long time. It's been a long time. It's been a long time. It's been a long time. It's been a long time.

Yeah, so you'll need a long run. Are you going to try to hit a- are you trying- are you trying for a pace?

No, I'm training just to finish.

just to finish yeah then then GPS art would be a good way to do a long run because you don't have to worry about time so much

Yeah.

I don't really talk to people about this, so it's fun for me, but also, I talk to people about this in my running group, but not in, you know, it's a really strange thing because it's never, it's always been a joke to me, but it's also like, it's become something

Mm -hmm.

really good for me like they're cute for me like you know create a creative creative out for me i take it you know i'm joking all the time i take it very seriously i spent a lot of time on those drawings and uh...

and uh... uh... a lot of people that you know the draw something and it kind of looks like an animal uh... and then they go run it and i i don't run anything unless i'm really really happy with it anymore like really like i spent a lot of time uh...

i really i won't even do it unless uh... you know i've considered like every possibility every every turn every variation of the turn sometimes uh... like the one i just finished i think i probably went to like fifty drafts or more but if you ever want me to show you how to do it in google it's it's not you know like when you're in google maps and you do like uh...

you know i'm driving from this point to this point that's not what that's not what i mean by when i say google maps and maybe and maybe if you want me to show you how it works i'd be happy to show you it's uh...

i don't think most people know about this

I sure have no idea how to do it.

Yeah. Yeah, so that was my major breakthrough was figuring this out. If you want me to show you I'm happy to.

It's a...

It made it a lot easier for, I mean we could do it another time, but it made it a lot easier for me to draw faster and more, you know it's like anything else, it becomes like a digital file where you save it and then you save a copy of it and then you edit that and then you can go back to the one you did before, just like any word document you're working on, Google lets you build maps that way and in my Google map,

I mean I probably have thousands and thousands of maps that I've drawn, like some of them just don't go anywhere but just like that's not what I mean by the directions part, that's something, that's Google maps but within Google maps there's a, it's not obvious but there's a way to manipulate that route and you can draw a line, you can draw a line from A to B and Google automatically make that line the quickest way from point A to point B but then what you do is you can drag that,

you can't do that in the directional area but there's another section of Google maps, if you look for it, I don't know why, it's not obvious and I don't think a lot of people know about it but for me, I think that's what, you know we're quite secretive and quite competitive but I suspect Lenny, Lenny Maughan in San Francisco uses that like I do and I suspect that, I suspect that, actually he's the only person I know that I'm pretty certain uses that as well but I think,

I think a lot of people are like, I think, you know, Gustav doesn't use that because he doesn't have to, he can just find an image, trace it and then just drop that image onto a mapping program, I don't know what he uses but he doesn't need to use what I use but I suspect that, I think that's probably, I mean to do a simple drawing now for me in Google maps would take me just days and days if I was using Strava or if I was drawing it on a map

Mm -hmm.

by hand. So anyway, I think that's really the secret for me was Google.

I think I'll have a look myself and try to figure it out, but then if it doesn't work, I'll message you. Yeah, good. But yeah, I can tell that you really enjoy what you're doing and it's been really cool to talk to someone who is so passionate about something.

Yeah, it's strange to be passionate about something like that, but it's become that way.

Yeah, I learnt a lot. Thank you for your insights and thank you for this very cool conversation. Do you mind if I quote you or like mention you in my thesis sometimes or like share some of the information that I'm doing today?

No, I don't, I don't mind at all.
