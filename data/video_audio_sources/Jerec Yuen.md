(has been running for 6 years now, joined in a charity race at work)

I organize a lot of free gps-art events. So a lot of runners turn up. It’s free. You get to meet different running community from London. And then they will turn up for the run without knowing what sort of drawings I’m doing. So it’s more like a surprise kind of thing. We run together and by the time you finish the run and then you get to sync it back to your phone, that’s when you have the surprise of what we have drawn. Sometimes it turns out to be a t-Rex or a different animal, like a dog or a chicken. So it’s quite a fun experience.

The GPS-art started at the end of 2019. I’ve been on holiday for a week up in Scotland. And because I’m on a holiday on the Christmas break, so I was thinking maybe I should do some running up there in Scotland. And then I started checking the maps to see whether there were any nice to run around. And then I saw this park that looked like a human face. So I had this idea of going out to see if I can draw the human face. And then I came back. It really looks like a human face. And then that idea itself rolled on and I started checking other parks in Scotland. And I found this park that looks like a t-Rex. The same thing again, I went to the run, came back and it sort of looked like a t-Rex. So it sort of built from there. And I had this idea: maybe I should come back to London and see whether I can draw more things in London. And then it grows from this idea into a fund-raising event. And then I organize running events for people to join me around as well.

At the beginning of GPS-art drawings, I was doing individual solo drawings on my own. And then I started having text messages from people, asking me to do group runs. It’s more fun to do them together in groups. So I started planning smaller drawings, because when I’m on my own I tend to do bigger drawings, it’s easier to do a bigger drawing when you’re on your own. But in the groups, people tend to run and draw together in smaller distances, below 12km.

The smallest one I’ve drawn is 7km, I guess. It’s more difficult if you do small distance, because there’re less lines for you to draw. 10km is average.

_On how his reasons for running changed over time_

For me, running was not really like a smooth line. Back in 2018 I was training hard for Berlin marathon. Training went quite well, till three weeks before race day I went to this trail running and then I broke one of my left toes. So from someone being super active, to be able to run a lot and then end up on crouches for three to four month. It was one of this really devastating moments in my life. Cause during that time when you can't do any exercise, I had to switch off all my social stuff, when you see other people doing exercise it's always quite sad. I'm fully recovered now and I'm thinking to help out and to give it back to the community to help spinal research and spinal cord injury, because I believe that not everyone has this opportunity to be active.

I love running and I love the creative sides of it. But combining both and being able to fundraise and to help a good charity, which is Spinal Research, to help paralysed people to live and active life again, I've organised GPS group events and after the events, I ask people for donations. So far, I've raised almost 800 pounds now.
