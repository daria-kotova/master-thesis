0:27 (when talking about his giraffe drawing) I have to admit it does get mixed reviews. Some people say the eye is too big and that real artists have a sense of propoetion. Others says that it's charmingly crude and remind them of Critters seen roaming about on Paleolithic cave art. And then there are those who say it would feel more at home on their fridge doors.

2:50 GPS doodling gave me a way to inject a sense of purpose into my rides. It gave me a way to disguise exercise as urban exploration and creative expression, a way to make exercise fun.

6:12 GPS device doesn't come with an eraser

6:37 (on technique "connecting the dots") I discovered quite by accident that if I pause my device at point A and restart it at pont B those lines connect or those dots connect with a straight line. And I use this technique to bring detail into some of my doodles where the roads do not cooperate.

8:07 Fitness is really just one part of the GPS doodlingequation, and the other is creative expression. ... We all have a right brain, the epicenter of creativity and expression. And in each of us , I believe, there is a deep desire to create and express. And what excites me most about the GPS doodline is that it takes intimidation out of artistic expression. If you can move, you can doodle. You can do this on your bike, you can do this on a walk, you can do this on a skateboard. I actually intentionally call it GPS doodling, because the word "art" can be a bit lofty and exclusive. Everybody doodles and anyone can GPS-doodle.

9:14 You don't acctually create them. You discover them. They're in the map just waiting to be found.

11:40 GPS-doodling has led me to explore many new roads. And that's the perfect metaphor for its appeal. As creative beings, we are driven to explore, to express ourselves and to explot media in new and intriguing ways.

12:35 explore, experiment, express yourself. On your bike, on your own two feet. The possibilities are limitless.
