youâ€™ll observe, etc.)

# Motivation

Running is originally an individual activity that nowadays can be shared collectively, both in real life and online, thanks to numerous running clubs and social network applications like Strava.

My own runnning journey started a year ago in May, when I got inspired supporting a friend running the Geneva marathon. Had not ver run before, I took up a challenge of training for 10k race in Lausanne in October 2023. It is while participating in regular runs with Geneva Run Club that I hit my first 10k before the race. After 10k in Geneva this May, I have decided to raise the stakes and register for half-marathon in Lausanne. New challenges may require new tools. My new Garmin watch and recently created Strava account happen to be the ones.

I am curious to see how this social network may affect my running practice. Will it motivate me to be more consistent with my trainings and maybe even push my limits? Or will it bring a negative side to the pracrice, making me compare myself to others? And what about the others? Are there any new interactions or situations born from using the app? Maybe there are some sideffects? I find it interesting to learn all this from within, being a fresh Strava user, but also by contacting the Strava community in Geneva and France. I have seen a lot of posts on Instagram with various memes related to Strava. Now I get to check them myself.

# Methodology

## What?

1. Interviews with users (people directly from Strava, Instagram, Geneva Run Club):

   - video calls
   - IRL (running with people one-to-one, running with Geneva Run Club, cafes)

2. Observations of runners in Geneva parks for finding interesting gestures / habbits

## Who?

Large scope:

- different ages
- men and women
- locals and foreigners
- different time of usage of the app
- different running experience
